氷に閉じこめて (Koori ni tojikomete) / Locked in Ice
Series: Promare
Artist: Superfly
Lyrics, composition: Shiho Ochi

漢字RomajiEnglish君は氷のように　冷たいけど
炎のような愛じゃ　解けちゃうけど
魔法に掛かるから
まだ　愛してもいいかな
見透かされてるようで　苦しいから
いつも遠い場所に　逃げちゃうのね
魔法に掛けられて
もっと　いい子にしてるから
まだ　信じても良いかな
私を凍らせて　今すぐ
嘘も本当も　抱き締めてあげるから
行かないで　消えないで
あの街の　雪の中に
光など見つけないでよ
君がいなくなると　灰になるの
燃え上がる想いが　焼き尽すの
もう一度　夢が叶うなら
幸せに還りたい
待っててもいいかな
愛は生き延びるはず
氷に閉じこめて　この手が
頬に心に　触れられるその瞬間ときまで
解けないわ　泣かないわ
美しき　氷の鎧
最後まで君を待ってる
氷に閉じこめて　この手が
頬に心に　触れられるその瞬間ときまで
解けないわ　泣かないわ
美しき　氷の鎧
最後まで君を待ってるKimi wa koori no you ni tsumetai kedo
Honoo no you na ai ja tokechau kedo
Mahou ni kakaru kara
Mada ai shitemo ii kana
Misukasareteru you de kurushii kara
Itsumo tooi basho ni nigechau no ne
Mahou ni kakerarete
Motto ii ko ni shiteru kara
Mada shinjitemo ii kana
Watashi wo koorasete ima sugu
Uso mo hontou mo dakishimete ageru kara
Ikanaide kienaide
Ano machi no yuki no naka ni
Hikari nado mitsukenaide yo
Kimi ga inaku naru to hai ni naru no
Moeagaru omoi ga yakitsukusu no
Mou ichido yume ga kanau nara
Shiawase ni naritai
Mattetemo ii kana
Ai wa ikinobiru hazu
Koori ni tojikomete kono te ga
Hoho ni kokoro ni furerareru sono toki made
Tokenai wa nakanai wa
Utsukushiki koori no yoroi
Saigo made kimi wo matteru
Koori ni tojikomete kono te ga
Hoho ni kokoro ni furerareru sono toki made
Tokenai wa nakanai wa
Utsukushiki koori no yoroi
Saigo made kimi wo matteruYou're as cold as ice but
The fire of love would melt you down
But since you cast a spell on me
I wonder if it's okay to love you
It's painful having your true feelings revealed
So you always run away to some place far away
I'm a much better kid
But since I'm under your spell
I wonder if it's okay to believe you
Freeze me right now
I'll embrace your truths and lies
Don't go, don't disappear
Don't find the light
Amidst that snowswept town
If you leave, I'll be reduced to ashes
These blazing feelings for you will burn to nothing
If dreams can come true again
Then I'd like to go back to being happy
I wonder if it's a good idea to wait
I know our love will survive
Lock me in ice; I won't melt, I won't cry
Until the moment my hand
Gets to touch your cheeks and heart
I'll wait for you until the very end
In this beautiful cage made of ice
Lock me in ice; I won't melt, I won't cry
Until the moment my hand
Gets to touch your cheeks and heart
I'll wait for you until the very end
In this beautiful cage made of ice

Howl to the heavens, awaken!

Do you remember how you felt, on that very first day? 
Distinctly we
Remember our
Beautiful encounter
We want to show you how much we've grown
Since that short time ago
We're doing our best every day
Always standing with you
By your side
We are dream-chasing rabbits
Jumping high towards the future!!
We'll always move forward, no matter when—that's just the way we are
Those eyes filled with passion
They're the same as ours
Even if we stumble and fall, we'll just get back up stronger than before
Our linked hands hold courage and hope
We will grasp them close and head onwards—ah,
Love it love it, la-la-la-life; rabi-rabi, la-la-la-life
Rather than hide in your timidity, let that voice in your heart be heard
We'll come to understand each other without shying away when we meet up tomorrow
That point we aim for
Is still so far in the future
It's alright to go on, step by step
Because even then at that time
We've been able to
Overcome it
Jumping high all together!!
Someday I'll remember how much I loved these days
We strive so hard to become
The best we can be
As we bring about splendor, our smiling faces blossom in the lingering petrichor
Those cherished moments
We will record brilliantly—ah,
Step by step, sha-la-la, we love it!! Cha-cha-cha
From now on and forever, we'll go brick by brick
Step by step, sha-la-la, we're Ra*bits!!
We will (we will)
Grant (grant)
Everyone's dreams!
No matter when, we'll always move forward, that's just the way we are
Those eyes filled with passion, they're the same as ours
Even if we stumble and fall, we'll just get back up stronger than before
Our linked hands hold courage and hope, we will grasp them close and head onwards—ah,
Love it love it, la-la-la-life; rabi-rabi, la-la-la-life

&quot;Love it love it&quot; and &quot;rabi-rabi&quot; are a play on &quot;rabbit rabbit&quot;

    <content><![CDATA[An apple a day keeps anyone away, if you throw it hard enough.
Series: Ace Attorney
Source: Nintendo DREAM July 2016 Issue
Characters: Phoenix Wright, Trucy Wright
Special Thanks: Lloyd



The question is, &quot;What is your favorite food or drink and why?&quot;

My favorite food, huh...

It&#39;s apples, right, Daddy?

Well, I don&#39;t hate them.

It must feel nice crunching through all that &quot;red stuff.&quot;[1]
Though, you said it would be even better if it had white frills[2] on it.

Wait, I don&#39;t remember saying that.

Huh?
Didn&#39;t you eat apples a lot after trials back then?
You bit into them with a glare as if it&#39;s your enemy.
...Or at least, that&#39;s what I heard from Miss Fey.

M-Maya...
Trucy, you really shouldn&#39;t trust her.

漢字RomajiEnglishおはよう　カーテン開けて
楽しげな街は　燦々と
キャラメルポップコーンと
何処かで聴いたマーチングソング
悪くはないかも
パレードが通りを抜けて
日々を揺らせば　感嘆を
トランクに仕舞いこんで

ああ　煌めきだしたわ

恋に落ちたみたい
通りを駆け抜ける
ああ　君は何様なのさ
心が揺れて　調子が狂うな
涙止まるまで
隣りにいてあげる
I know パレードは終わりさ
此処から始めようぜ
明日には
いつもの退屈な日々が戻ってくるとか
手を繋ごう
僕ら何も無くたって　笑って過ごせるよ
声が枯れるまで
歌い続けて欲しい
ああ　僕は何様なのさ
口が悪くて　ほんとにごめんね。
心晴れるまで
話を聞かせてよ
You know? パレードは終わりさ

探してたピースは
此処にあったんでしょう

The cheerful city's shining with
Caramel popcorn and
A marching band heard in the distance
Maybe this isn't so bad
The parade passing through the street
Shake the days and cause wonder
Put that suitcase away
Because I'm consumed with wanderlust
Ah, it's starting to sparkle!
The answer doesn't exist here
So c'mon, c'mon, let's move forward!
I ran through the streets
Like I'm falling in love
Ah, who the hell are you?
I'm having mixed feelings—my mind's out of control
I will be right next to you
Until those tears stop falling
I know, the parade's over
So let's start here
I heard that the usual everyday boredom's
Coming back tomorrow
So let's go hand in hand
And spend the time laughing at how nothing's there
I want you continue singing
Until you lose your voice
Ah, who the hell am I?
I'm really sorry for having a sharp tongue
I will listen to your stories
Until you brighten up
You know? The parade's over
So let's start here
The answer I've been searching for
Was here all along, huh?
I know, the parade's over
So c'mon, show me your smile

    <content><![CDATA[Riamu just wants some friends.
I'll recreate the subbed video one day.
Series: THE IDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls
Characters: Akari Tsujino, Akira Sunazuka, Riamu Yumemi
TLC: Koi



Sigh, I&#39;m depressed. Being an idol isn&#39;t fun at all.
I knew it would suck, but...
This is depressing. This is just fucking depressing!
Aaah, I want someone to comfort me!
To keep me company, to give me attention, to tell me everything&#39;s alright...
I want it! I wanna be idolized!
...But no one&#39;s ever going to idolize me or whatever.
This break room&#39;s walls are the only friends I have!
Aaah, I&#39;m sooo lonelyyyy!

Akira-chan, here!
This is the break room everyone&#39;s talking about!

I see.
#BreakRoom #AKA
#GameRoom #FunTimesWithEveryone

But I don&#39;t think this is a game room...
Ah! It&#39;s Riamu-san!
Riamu-saaan, good work out there!

Good work.

Eh!?!?
...Huh? Is this a dream?
Is someone calling me?
Is this a dream...?

......?

......

Why aren&#39;t you guys saying anything?!
You&#39;re being awfully silent! It&#39;s suffocating!
Can&#39;t you be a little bit nicer to me?

Hmm... Ah!
Riamu-san, thank you for performing with us in our last gig♪
There were so many other idols!
The city&#39;s amazing as well!
It was quite enjoya-ple!
What about you, Akira-chan?

Well, that was the first time I had this feeling...
Also, there were a lot of idols wearin&#39; good clothes...
Lots of nice clothes.

Ehh, it wasn&#39;t good enough for me.
I wanna stand out and get a shit ton of attention...!

Wow... Amazing, Riamu-san...
You&#39;re really unique, and you have a nice dream too.
I guess that&#39;s what being an idol is all about.

I wouldn&#39;t say that her dream&#39;s that great...
She definitely has personality, though.

Ugh, I wonder if I can match up to you...
I&#39;m not the type that stands out too much, y&#39;know?

Alright then! Let&#39;s stir up some drama while we&#39;re at it!
As long as we&#39;re together, we&#39;ll be fine!

...Huh?

No, no! You can&#39;t just start drama...!
All the things you care about will go to waste!

But there are so many other idols out there!
If you don&#39;t stand out as much as possible, you won&#39;t survive!
Hey, Riamu-chan wants to survive!

Don&#39;t.
Stirrin&#39; up drama will just cause trouble for the agency.
Aren&#39;t there other ways you can think of to survive?

I wanna stand out! With drama!
Isn&#39;t starting drama mental?
I wanna stand out as a joke!

Eh...
Riamu-san, why are you so problematic...?

It&#39;s because I wanna stand out!
Because I want people to care about me!
Because I wanna get some attention, at least!

If it&#39;s like that, then there should be another way.
With drama, you&#39;d constantly have to worry about dealin&#39; with radical opinions.

...So, I should just join the military.

The military!? What the he—
Ah, I mean, why?

Because people in the military are really smart, obviously!
Let&#39;s come up with some genius ideas that&#39;ll turn me into a cool officer character!
I&#39;m 19, y&#39;know!?
I want my juniors to rely on me!
I wanna make you two happy!

W-What should we do, Akira-chan?
Riamu-san saying all of that isn&#39;t any good!

Hey, both of you calm down.
First off, it makes no sense to havin&#39; a panic attack here.
Don&#39;t people relax here?

T-That&#39;s right! Ahahahaha!
I just started panicking all of a sudden!
Uh... Hm... Eh...
Ah!
Why don&#39;t we get some ramen?

Ramen?

Let&#39;s go eat!
Eating tasty food with friends always cheers me up!
Cheer up, Riamu-san.
Your problematic thoughts might go away!
Besides, Tokyo&#39;s ramen always looked so trendy and delicious. I&#39;ve always wanted to try it...!

Ah... In that case, I know a good place.
It&#39;s from my hometown that just opened a Tokyo branch...
But I guess that isn&#39;t really Tokyo ramen, huh.

Aha♪ As long as it&#39;s good, it&#39;s OK!

Eh, huh!? What the hell!?
I&#39;m gonna eat ramen with someone...!?
Is this a dream? A dream to end all dreams!?

This is reality.

Riamu-san, let&#39;s go as a grou-ple♪

You&#39;re joking... You&#39;re seriously not joking...?
Idols are so nice...
I wuv nice idols...!

Ow ow ow ow...! That huuurt...

What&#39;s wrong, Teru-san? Did you get injured somewhere?

Nah, it just hurts if I press down on my skin here. I think it&#39;s a pressure point.
Hey, Sakuraba. Do you know which body part this pressure point connects to?

Dunno. It&#39;s probably a stupid one since it&#39;s you.

What!? Hmm... If it&#39;s gonna be like that, I wonder how you&#39;ll react.
If you feel pain when I press here, then it means you&#39;re also stupid! Take that!

I-It doesn&#39;t hurt... I really don&#39;t feel any pain... I&#39;m fine! Let me go at once...!

Wow, seriously hiding the pai—
Oww!? S-Stop! Sakuraba!

I guess it hurts just a bit... I wonder which pressure point it is? I&#39;m curious.

One day in an empty classroom after summer vacation

Mayoi-dono~! Mayoi-dono, might you happen to be present?
Hm? It appears that no one is here. We made an appointment to meet in the empty classroom after school, but have I arrived here first?

Pant, pant...

Oh...? Is the sound of breathing perhaps coming from...
...the inside of that broom closet!?

Chiiiief! I knew you&#39;d notice meeeeee♪ You saw right through my camouflage!
As one would expect from the Ninja Association&#39;s leader! I&#39;ll follow you for the rest of my life♪

Hehe. My suspicions were correct. It is unthinkable for a reliable person like you to have been late to our meeting, so I knew something had to be up.
Anyway, Mayoi-dono, let us begin our club activities for today!

Certainly, let&#39;s. Will we be checking the request box today as well?
I&#39;ll start up the PC, and... Oh my, it looks like we received two submissions.

Ooh, what a success! We just set it up this week, but we have already received two submissions... It appears our efforts have been noticed!

Receiving anonymous requests like this is fun... It feels quite ninja-like.

Well, to be precise, it is hero work. But it fits us too, since we&#39;re ninjas of justice♪

&quot;Hero&quot; work?

Ah, it makes sense that you would not know about this. Last year, Morisawa-dono opened a request box and used it to help those in need~
There was no one to take it over after he graduated, and thus, I received permission to do so.
Morisawa-dono looked delighted; he even said, &quot;It&#39;s wonderful that you&#39;re reaching out and helping others!&quot;

I see... So you&#39;re carrying on his legacy.

Well, it is not as if I am only doing this out of a sense of justice like Morisawa-dono did; I&#39;m not nearly as saintly, after all...
...Because someday, the Ninja Association will become the Ninja Club!
If we become an official school club, we will undoubtedly gain more members, and we can receive plenty of funding. It will be just one good thing after another!
As the head of the Ninja Association, it is natural for that to be my goal!

Ufufu. Even if your aim is to obtain a reward, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that you&#39;re performing good deeds.
If you need stealth, leave it to me. It&#39;s a bad habit of mine to flee and hide when I encounter others, but in the context of being a &quot;ninja,&quot; that weakness becomes a strength.
And I&#39;d certainly rather be a &quot;ninja&quot; than a &quot;phantom&quot;...♪

&quot;Phantom&quot;...?

Oh, it&#39;s nothing. Just a personal matter.
Ah, oops. Chatting with you is so fun that I ended up prolonging our discussion... Shall we take a look at what we received in the request box?

Ah, yes. We should do that.
So, what does the box contain this time?

The first submission is a request to help clean things up around the school. Judging from the manner of speech, it seems to be from the person who sent in a request earlier this week[1] as well.

Ooh, it surprises me that we&#39;d get a repeat requester.

Indeed. Perhaps they have been trying to support the Ninja Association by bringing us jobs to help us establish a track record.
I am unsure of who it is, but if they want the Ninja Association to become a real club, they could be someone within Yumenosaki Academy.
Ufufu. It&#39;s like they&#39;re our &quot;Daddy-Long-Legs&quot;[2]—our mysterious benefactor...♪

Hmm. If that is the case, I feel it would certainly be more fun if they could join the Ninja Association and partake in our activities...
No, this also depends on the time frame it is occurring in. Perhaps it could be someone like Mayoi-dono!

Huh? M-Me...?

Of course~ I never expected a third year to join the Ninja Association.
When I think of how I am able to spend this much time with a companion of mine, my heart overflows with gratitude♪

C-Chiiiiief...♪ (hugs)

Mayoi-dono~♪ (hugs back)

Ufufu. To be on a honeymoon with Chief, with no one getting in our way... It&#39;s comfortable to the point where I&#39;d be just fine dying in your aaaaarms...♪

You mustn&#39;t be so hasty! The pair of us are fated companions who have finally managed to cross paths. It is too early to reach the end of our journey!
There was another request, yes? If so, we must fulfill our duty and be of service.
Look, I see another message there. Given the title, I&#39;m quite curious as to what it may contain.

Let&#39;s see... Oh, what&#39;s this...?
&quot;A Request to the Members of the Ninja Association: Participate in Our Grand Opening Event&quot;...?


	

Translation Notes
↑ In-game, the request is said to be from &quot;last week.&quot; However, as Shinobu established earlier, the request box was only set up &quot;this week.&quot; It was decided that for the sake of consistency and making any sort of sense, we would write it as &quot;earlier this week&quot; in this chapter. This will be fixed if there are any official changes later on.↑ A reference to a novel of the same name, in which a girl from an orphanage is given money by an unknown benefactor so that she can go to college. Though she is not allowed to know who he is, it's revealed at the end that a man she met during her time in college and grew attached to was her benefactor.]]></content>

10 minutes later

Alright, are the two from the Ninja Association finished changing?
The grand opening event is soon, so apply your makeup quickly. If you&#39;re having trouble, I am willing to be of assistance♪
 I have plenty of experience as an actor, you know. So I can assist with your makeup...♪

Nah, you can&#39;t just do makeup—you can do pretty much anything.

I can&#39;t just do &quot;anything&quot;! For example, if I were thrown into a blast furnace, even I could only give a thumbs up before sinking.

That&#39;s such a weird scenario, though?
Anyways... Don&#39;t be afraid to let me know if you&#39;re having trouble, Sengoku.

Much obliged. Can you check if I have any stains on the back of my jacket, then?

Ah. If I coul—

Oh my. It&#39;s quite rude to interrupt two friends talking, Mister Phantom.
 Let us leave them to themselves and talk about love! I have a feeling you and I are birds of a feather♪

Um... Huh...?
(Scary! I don&#39;t get along too well with this person, but he keeps insisting on getting closer to me?)

Tehehe. Please don&#39;t be afraid! As you are the phantom and I am the clown, don&#39;t we both wear a mask?

W-Where on earth did that pigeon come from...!?

There aren&#39;t any tricks or gimmicks around here, tehe♪

Hey, what are you two doing? It&#39;s almost time for the grand opening, so please stop fooling around!
 Especially you, Hibiki-senpai! You&#39;re only here because Hokuto-senpai couldn&#39;t make it! Control yourself!
 You became a full-fledged member of society a long time ago. The academy clearly doesn&#39;t have your back anymore.

Ah, the good ol&#39; scolding...☆ However, the real world is far more selective than a school packed with a wide variety of people.
 Even impudent behavior can be shadowed with an impudent environment. That is particularly true in show business—a place out of the ordinary.
In retrospect, aren&#39;t you still the same old Tomoya-kun? And I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way!

You threw that at me so casually... I&#39;m hurt.
I mean, just because you said it wasn&#39;t &quot;in a bad way&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you can just go say whatever the hell you please!
 Like, I was always told that I&#39;m too &quot;normal&quot; since childhood. Poppin&#39; Party[1] would never happen if I was the same as before.

That&#39;s wonderful. You are raising the standards of what&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; in your own way~ It&#39;s a different approach from merely excelling in a single area, and I think it&#39;s commendable.

Whatever you just said pisses me off... But that&#39;s just who you are.
Sorry for getting carried away, Sengoku. You don&#39;t have any stains on your jacket from what I see.

That&#39;s a relief to hear. I finished applying my makeup, so I am all geared up.

Ooh, you&#39;re pretty good at this.

Ryuseitai has done a lot of work in small venues, so I&#39;m rather skilled at getting myself ready.
 Though, I cannot cross-dress, unlike you all in the Drama Club.

I-I&#39;m also done.

You are all amazing at this! We must make haste now, Miss Anzu is waiting for us.

Oh, shoot. Is it almost time?

I hear people discussing the sorts of routines we&#39;ll do over there.

&quot;Routines&quot;...?

Correct. Since we are servers, there is practically no need for us to cook. One of those routines appears to be writing with white sauce[2] in front of the customers.

It&#39;s like what maid cafés do, right? Where they go &quot;moe moe kyun☆&quot;[3] while drawing hearts with ketchup?

Heheh. Good guess, Tomoya-kun! It&#39;s exactly what you say it is!
 As idols and actors, we are sure to be beautiful, graceful, and sometimes adorable! I am certain the customers will be pleased♪
To show the others an example, please write &quot;LOVE&quot; in extra-large letters on my omurice...☆

Ahaha. This is Dead End Café, so I&#39;ll be drawing a skull instead. Is that alright with you? ♪

Oh my, even how you treat your superiors has changed~ Good grief, who taught you these manners?


	

Translation Notes
↑ &quot;Poppin' Party&quot; is the name of Nazuna's welcome back concert that took place in High Five! A pretty significant event for Tomoya, especially since he's performing in it as Ra*bits' new leader.↑ Also known as béchamel sauce. Often used in omurice, but not really to &quot;write with&quot; unlike ketchup...↑ &quot;Moe moe kyun&quot; is an incantation to make food taste delicious. It can be localized as &quot;abracadabra&quot; or &quot;bibbidi bobbidi boo,&quot; but they don't give the same cutesy vibe. Popularized by K-On!]]></content>

A few days later

Aah—eep...!?
Urgh... People are terrifying... A shopping district like this is simply hell...

Well, experience is the best teacher. I was not terribly good with crowds either, but recently I&#39;ve been getting a bit more used to them.

I-I see. I feel like no matter what I do, I still end up feeling sick in crowded places...
   Chief. Would you mind if I took a quick break on that bench over there?

That&#39;s fine with me~ I shall contact our client to let them know that we will meet up here instead.

I-I&#39;m sorry... I probably come off as a terribly feeble individual.

Please don&#39;t push yourself too much. You are my one and only companion in the Ninja Association!
Ah, right. There is a vending machine close by, so I will go grab something for you to drink. I&#39;m sure that if you hydrate yourself a bit, you will feel better...♪

I&#39;m dreadfully sorry for everything I keep putting you through. Thank you very much...

We have each others&#39; backs~ Well then, I will be right back.

......
(Eek!? S-Someone sat down next to me... Why, for what reason? There should be other empty benches available if they wanted to sit...)
(H-Huh? They just said &quot;Good morning,&quot; didn&#39;t they? To me? I-I wasn&#39;t hallucinating, was I...?)
(Eep... Is it possibly a fan of mine? I don&#39;t feel comfortable just ignoring them, so I should try to say at least something...)
D-Do you possibly need something from me...?!
Eep! Close, too close! Your face is way too clooooose!
 Ah, um, I... T-There isn&#39;t anything particularly interesting about my face even if you inspect it closely... I think there&#39;s some misunderstanding, so please back up a bit...!
Oh, Miss Producer...?
I-I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m bad at making eye contact with people, so I didn&#39;t realize it was you.
 Aah... That&#39;s why you leaned so close to me? To help me remember who you were? Yes, we have met several times in the ES building, so please pardon my rudeness...
......
(What an awkward silence...! Should I try to start a conversation about something...?)

Oh, you&#39;re here, Producer-dono—Anzu-dono. It seems you&#39;ve already gotten Mayoi-dono to open up♪

Aah, Chief! My savior!

Ahaha. You&#39;re truly that bad with people?
 I thought you may have arrived, Anzu-dono, so I bought a bottle of tea for you as well~ Green tea was the only variety available, though.
There is no need to offer me words of thanks. You were the one who submitted the request to our box, after all.

Ah, you submitted a request anonymously, but then revealed your identity after? I was under the impression that every requester has to remain completely anonymous...
 However, why were we requested for work off-campus?
No, it&#39;s not that I take any issue with such. I merely thought that it would be connected in some way to our in-school activities.

That was a curious matter to me as well. Our recent requests have primarily been from ES, so...?
Hm? It&#39;s quite hard to explain, so you’d like us to follow you to the location itself? I see.
Are you alright with that, Mayoi-dono?

E-Eep. To not know any of the details is exceedingly scary...
But I understand. I&#39;ll follow your lead.
 Through fire, through water, until the ends of the Earth...!

Location: Dead End Café


This is...?

Err, Miss Producer, what is a &quot;Dead End Café&quot;?
 I understand what cafés are, but not a &quot;dead end&quot; one... Do you think we will be able to serve p-poisoned coffee?

You never told us that we would be serving poisoned food, Anzu-dono! That is so unpleasant, as the Ninja Association is a wholesome group!

Ahaha, you&#39;re overthinking it.

Ooh...? What brings you here, Mashiro-dono?

That&#39;s my line, Sengoku~ Did Dead End Café reach out to you guys too?

Correct. To be precise, we were referred by Anzu-dono. Did she do the same to you?

Yeah, the Drama Club&#39;s also referred by her. These costumes make it the perfect job for us, y&#39;know?

It truly suits you all, as always~
Then, why are you wearing a costume at a café...?

Haha, I&#39;m not so sure about that either.
 Well, the café&#39;s theme is something like: a girl wanders into the underworld, where dead servers entertain and cook for her.

Hmm, so that is what&#39;s popular as of late... Were you aware of such a thing, Mayoi-dono?

No, I&#39;m not familiar with the trends... But that is a unique theme.

It really is—Ayase-senpai? You were up early today, but I didn&#39;t expect to see you here.

You were offered the same job too, M-Mashiro-san?

Hm? Do you two know each other?

Yes. Everyone in ALKALOID transferred dorms after MDM. Mashiro-san and I have been roommates since then.

Fair enough. You have a surprisingly close friend there.

N-No, we&#39;re not that close! I tend to be extremely shy; therefore, I&#39;m not really familiar with him!

Ahaha. Please don&#39;t be modest. I&#39;m younger than you, so I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re casual with me, okay?

I-I&#39;m formal by default so it&#39;s alright!

Ahaha. Either way, it&#39;s still nice to have someone to talk to.
Anzu-san, you referred both the Drama Club and the Ninja Association here because of our connection to Yumenosaki, right?
I see. So Dead End Café is run by a fellow student&#39;s parents.
We were referred because you heard that our club activities were going well, huh...

We&#39;re under an entertainment agency for the time being. Thus, requesting jobs up-front goes against my moral code...
Actually, there doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone else from the Drama Club here—
Huh? There&#39;s something on the ceiling...!

Ghehe. You have finally noticed me♪

Eeeek! A-An Eccentric...!

Whoaaa!? H-H-How the hell were you able to stick onto the ceiling, Hibiki-senpai!?

Hehe, you&#39;re too naive, Tomoya-kun! Since I&#39;m an entertainer, I always have to look for ways to make an amazing entrance☆
Now, allow me to properly introduce myself. It has been quite a while, Miss Anzu. I am your Wataru Hibiki...☆
It appears that there are others with you too. Let us all work hard today!

Aaaaaaiiiiiieeeeee!

Don&#39;t be so nervous, Mayoi-dono.
There&#39;s no need to be so scared of him. How he behaves may be a bit strange, but the Three Eccentrics—including Shinkai-dono—are all charming people.

Sometime after the café has opened

Welcome~♪
 Here is your seat, milord. I shall deliver you the menu posthaste!
 Ah, do pardon me. I lived and died as a ninja. Thus, I unintentionally slip back into my previous way of speaking at times.
 Right then, I shall be off!
 Whew... Being both a ninja and a butler is a bit tricky, isn&#39;t it?
 It is also much busier than I was expecting. Is that causing you anxiety, Mayoi-dono?

......

Alas, it seems I was correct! You appear quite down, Mayoi-dono! Are you alright?

......

Mayoi-dono...?

Ah, my apologies... The manager told me I&#39;m &quot;really as silent as the dead!&quot; so I&#39;ve been staring at the floor and making not a single peep, but...
Urgh... Is this really okay? Rather, I feel like it gives a strange impression that customers would be more pleased if I acted coldly.

Ahaha. This kind of role does fit you though, Ayase-senpai. Plus, it balances out with our noisy coworker, so it&#39;s fine. You know who I mean, the dead ex-clown—

Amazing! ☆ It has been a long time since I had contact with the living~
 Were you lured to the underworld by your desire to seek pleasure?
I, a failed street performer during my lifetime, have no need to worry about struggling with poverty or how others rate me here!
 We have an eternity! I shall be here for eternity!
Hehehe. And when one is trapped in eternity, their conversations do tend to eternally meander. Now then, would you like to order? ☆
 Hm? What do I recommend from the menu?
Let&#39;s see... If you wish, I could draw a portrait of you with our special sauce!
 I have also long been able to write using grains of rice; detail work is my forte!
 I&#39;m dead, so I can illustrate as many dishes as you wish♪ Afflictions such as fatigue and the cold do not affect me any longer! ♪
I see! Two Dead Omurice, coming right up~♪

Man, you can tell how damn loud he is just by looking at him.
But because he stands out so much, we&#39;re going viral on social media.
 There might be an even bigger crowd in the afternoon since he&#39;s a special guest for today.

E-Even bigger...!? Just the thought of it makes me dizzy...

Keep yourself together~ There were far more people in the audience during MDM, so there&#39;s no need to be frightened.
Oh? Anzu-dono is watching us from the kitchen and smiling.
Alright! At this pace, we will become a Ninja Club in a single bound! Let us do our very best!

U-Um. Chief...

There is nothing to worry about. You are doing just fine as you are right now, Mayoi-dono♪
 Your outfit suits you well, and when you take up a silent character, the charm of your handsome features only doubles♪

T-Thank you very much...

Ah, yes. A new order has come in? I shall excuse myself here, then!
Oh, this manner of speech? I lived out my days as a ninja, see—

......

Mister Phantom. You look so miserable that one would think you&#39;ve fallen into despair. Are you getting into character?
 Hehehe. If so, you&#39;ve nailed it♪
While I am butting into your affairs a bit, won&#39;t you listen to the tale I have to tell? It is the way of life for both clowns and actors to perfectly pull off their given roles.
 Play your desired role as how others desire it to be. If you do not, you will bring about complaints that you are &quot;boring,&quot; that the audience was &quot;let down&quot;... That is the sad fate of a clown like myself.
All humans want to be loved. When a clown is loved, it keeps their art alive. For me, that brings both hope and a feeling of resignation.
 But even having said that, you don&#39;t need to go beyond your limits to stand on stage. Those who work behind the scenes have their own happiness.
Mister Phantom. While I&#39;ve been observing you, you&#39;ve nearly stumbled about two or three times—are you feeling alright?

...I&#39;m alright. You don&#39;t have to worry about that.

Hm. I see! Do pardon me for sticking my nose where it doesn&#39;t belong~☆
Tehehe. We have spoken for too long. I tend to get quite in-character for all of my roles.
 I won&#39;t be able to write letters on as many omurice as I need to like this.
I can handle the customers myself, so... Go help out in the kitchen, if you would please?

...Understood.
......
(You were probably aiming your words at me rather than just telling a story about yourself, weren&#39;t you? Hibiki-san.)
(It&#39;s just as you say. I can&#39;t become someone like you Eccentrics and the myriad of other geniuses that exist in this world. Anyone having expectations for me is incredibly frightening.)
(Because I am a &quot;phantom&quot;—a trivial, hideous existence compared to yours.)
(I suppose it&#39;s a beautiful thing, to play the role you&#39;ve been called upon to play. But for me...that&#39;s too heavy of a burden.)
(It may not be the right way to say this, but... Even if it disappoints someone, I don&#39;t want to hurt those who love me—)
(Because I&#39;m a weak, pitiful existence that can&#39;t fulfill the role others want me to play.)

A few hours later, during break time

Nice work, everyone~! Man, that was a lot busier than I&#39;d imagined!
Looks like some people made reservations in advance, but there&#39;s already a line for those who couldn&#39;t get in during lunch♪
Sengoku&#39;s role as a former ninja fit the theme well, so the customers were pleased~♪

Indeed. It was all swith improvisation, but they welcomed me with open arms.
One customer happened to be a Ryuseitai fan and ordered a multitude of dishes from me—
Namely Dead Omurice, Dead End Parfait, and some Dead Black...coffee. I was also able to chat with them every time they made an order.

Heheheh, you are surpassing all of my expectations. The Drama Club cannot afford to lose here!

Of course. I&#39;d say Hibiki-senpai&#39;s acting more like support, passing orders from person to person and such.

With the kitchen receiving more orders than it can handle, it&#39;s as though he&#39;s keeping it from spiraling out of control by coordinating magic tricks and small talk.

That&#39;s because my duty is to keep the customers satisfied~ I thought by doing those, I could avoid running into trouble and buy some time.
Hehehe. Now that we survived the busy lunch hour without a scratch, let us take a break.
...Or at least, that is what I would like to say.

Hmm?

Take a look around. Don&#39;t you think there&#39;s someone missing?

&quot;Someone missing&quot;... Anzu-san just came out of the kitchen, but that&#39;s not exactly &quot;strange&quot;...
Mayoi-senpai isn&#39;t here... Didn&#39;t he say that he had to &quot;powder his nose&quot;[1] earlier?

He is using the restroom. The door is locked shut.

Hehehe. I&#39;ve picked up on something! My hair sensors have been activated...

What the actual hell does that even mean!?

How remarkable, Hibiki-dono! I thought this ability of yours was just hearsay—I didn&#39;t know you were truly capable of this!
Perhaps I should&#39;ve recruited you for the Ninja Association while you were still a student...

Oops. Haven&#39;t you seen this little trick before, Sengoku-kun? It&#39;s a bit like applying magic to your hair—but let us return to the matter at hand.
Judging from the reverberations in the air, there is no one in the restroom...♪ It is likely that Mister Phantom escaped through the window.

Egad, you are utterly correct! There is no sign of him behind the door!

Huh, you can sense that too?

Sensing one&#39;s presence behind barriers is among the first techniques a ninja must acquire!
 Anyhow, Mayoi-dono shouldn&#39;t have gone too far... I do not know what came over him, but I shall search for him right away!
 Oh? You want to come along too, Anzu-dono? I appreciate your aid!
 Hmm. You want me to continue working, so you&#39;re going to look for him yourself?
 ...I cannot let you do all of that alone.
 Mayoi-dono is the only other member of the Ninja Association. I can&#39;t abandon him, no matter what the circumstances are.
 Surely you understand, correct?

I agree with Sengoku-kun, Miss Anzu.
As I am an Eccentric, I don&#39;t know much about Mister Phantom. Could it be that working with me put a heavy burden on him?
However, a play is nothing without actors to perform it. I&#39;m certain that Mister Phantom doesn&#39;t want us to continue without our full cast.
If you find something to be a burden, then I shall shoulder that burden. Such is the grace of having a supporting actor by your side.
Leave the café to me. Tomoya-kun, could you give me a hand?

Um... Well... I&#39;m sure Hibiki-senpai will be fine. This dude has ridiculously high stats anyways. You should go focus on finding Ayase-senpai.

...Much obliged. If you insist, I shall search for Mayoi-dono at once!

Depiction of a panic attack ahead

 Sob, sob...
(Aah... I ran away without changing, so everyone is staring at me... It hurts.)
(I mean, of course they would be. A grown adult dressed in a strange outfit curled up on a bench, hugging his knees and crying...)
(But my tears aren&#39;t stopping.)
(Chiiiief... Please forgive me. I&#39;m such a lowly creature!)
(But I can&#39;t do anything about iiiiit! If things... If things continue like this...!)
(I-I can&#39;t... I c-can&#39;t breathe. I can&#39;t remember how to breathe. I feel like my mind&#39;s in a haze...)
(It&#39;s impossible for me after all. He—Hibiki-san said that he lives by meeting others&#39; expectations...)
(But I can&#39;t do that.)
(...I felt like I was going to lose consciousness several times just from all of the people looking at me.)
(Surrounded by bright, sparkling people like ALKALOID, I still felt like there was something I could do.)
(But in a job like this, with all of us working individually to draw our customers&#39; attention, it felt like the burden on me specifically had increased.)
(If I continued trying to do my job at the café, I would have collapsed—Dead End Café would take a huge blow, and it would be my fault.)
(By asking the Ninja Association for a favor, they were taking a risk.)
(And if I ruined it, the association—a place beloved to me—would certainly crumble and disappear into nothing.)
(Even though Chief has been trying so desperately to fulfill his desire of turning it into a real club.)
(If it comes to that, it&#39;d be better for me to return to the darkness where I once was.)
(If I can avoid hurting anyone, then living in a desolate place where the light never touches is a much better choice for me.)
(You gave me love, so I will sacrifice myself for the sake of that love. The Phantom of the Opera ended things the same way, didn&#39;t he?)
(It doesn&#39;t matter how much despair I feel, so long as the one I love can be truly happy. I don&#39;t mind if you despise me for running from my responsibilities.)
 ...Thank you so very much, Chief. Now, it&#39;s time to sever the bond between us.
 This is...truly a dead end.

One hour later

He isn&#39;t here either... Just where on earth did Mayoi-dono disappear to?
 Anzu-dono, did you spot him on your end?
Hm, so you caught neither hide nor hair of him. That&#39;s a problem... Mayoi-dono is very good at hiding, which can make it quite difficult for anyone searching for him.
Oh, why are you pulling out your phone, Anzu-dono? Do you have some kind of secret strategy?
 I see... Since he&#39;s still wearing Dead End Café&#39;s uniform, perhaps people will be talking about him on social media?
Interesting, this method didn&#39;t cross my mind at all!
 I am impressed indeed, Anzu-dono. I was so flustered that such an idea hadn&#39;t occurred to me.
Alright, I&#39;ll do some searching on my phone as well!
 Keyword, keyword... Would something like &quot;ALKALOID&quot; work?
Hmmm... I&#39;m not seeing anything. I suppose it isn&#39;t that easy. I&#39;ll try a different word...
Oh? Did you find something, Anzu-dono?
Oho... So you found something on a post that mentioned the department store on Saison Avenue. This photo...is certainly of Mayoi-dono, isn&#39;t it?
Hm...? Why is he curled up on a bench? How strange.
No, it won&#39;t do any good to make assumptions from the photo. I would like to ask Mayoi-dono himself for details. Let us head to the location in the photo immediately.
That was an impressive feat, Anzu-dono. Perhaps it&#39;s much like the old saying: &quot;If you want to hide a tree, hide it within a forest&quot;... And if you want to hide a person, do so within a crowd.
I have just noticed the multitude of &quot;eyes&quot;—phone cameras—pointed at him.
It would be good if Mayoi-dono is unharmed despite all the gazes upon him, but...for some reason, I am incredibly concerned.

Location: Dead End Café


Welcome~♪
 Yes, the restaurant is full right now. Please put your name on the waiting list, and we&#39;ll call you when a table is available.
&quot;How long will it take&quot;? Umm, I&#39;d say around 30 minutes. Apologies for the delay.
(This is bad... It&#39;s impossible to keep up with everything when two of our servers are away...)
(I wonder if this is too much for even Hibiki-senpai to handle...?)

(Whispering) Tomoya-kun, Tomoya-kun.

Yeah, what is it, Hibiki-senpai?

I suddenly feel like putting on a show. Would you be so kind as to become my assistant and lend me a hand?

Hah? Just when I thought you&#39;d say that...
Generally speaking, if you were to do that, the table turnover would decrease.
The people waiting outside would get mad and start filing complaints.

That is precisely why I want to do it, Tomoya-kun! Please put aside common sense and think for yourself. Now, take a close look around the café...☆
Although there are no empty seats, there is still an abundance of empty space within the café.
We can therefore let everyone in and entertain them with a performance as they wait to be seated.
Why don&#39;t we bet on the possibility that Sengoku-kun will arrive with Mister Phantom before the end of our show? The moment they return, we&#39;ll have enough hands to resolve this entire situation.

Eh? Well, it is possible in theory. But...

&quot;But&quot;? Now, Tomoya-kun, surely you can&#39;t be entertaining the possibility of failure?
I&#39;m not too fond of boasting, but allow me to remind you that I am the best of the best—that I am one of the Five Eccentrics, Wataru Hibiki!
I shan&#39;t perform for merely 30 minutes, but an hour—no, I could even do this for all eternity!
Indeed, I could provide everyone with so much amazing, they forget the passing of time itself! ♪
Or were you entertaining the possibility that Miss Anzu and the rest won&#39;t return in time? Oh dear, I don&#39;t recall raising such a heartless child.

Since when did I ever see you as my dad!?
...Fine. Whatever. I&#39;ll go along with your plans, if you insist.
After all, I believe that they&#39;ll come back as well.

Splendid! I knew you would say that♪
Now then, Tomoya-kun, please let everyone in at once! We shall make all of them have the time of their lives—it&#39;s showtime! ♪

God, you truly are a natural-born entertainer, huh?
Go break a leg, Hibiki-senpai! You better apologize if this show of yours fails!

Hehehe. If it came to that, I&#39;d give you permission to boil or burn me, to reprobate me in any way you&#39;d see fit. But fear not, I&#39;d sooner perish than allow such mistakes to occur...
Though, I&#39;m already dead right now♪
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls—come one, come all! The dead man&#39;s act is about to begin! All payments can be made later on♪
Welcome to Dead End Café&#39;s surprise grand opening show! Brought to you by the passerby street performer, your very own Wataru Hibiki...☆

......
 Ah... I was so exhausted from crying that I ended up nodding off...
 The sun&#39;s already setting. The others are probably still incredibly busy at Dead End Café. Urgh, I feel so guilty...
But... Even if I went back now, it&#39;s too late. I must live with this guilt clinging to me; that is the fate that has been imposed upon me.
 To think that I was driven into this much of a panic simply from encountering that innumerably large crowd of people...

I see, I see. I&#39;d like to be briefed on aaaaall the details!

C-Chief...? Why are you behind me!? Wait, why are you hiding behind that statue!?

Heh heh heh, do not tell me that you have forgotten...? I am a ninja! As such, it is a breeze to mask my presence within this large of a crowd♪
 Oof... Alright. Dashdashdash...♪
 I was searching for your whereabouts with Anzu-dono. However, you looked rather unwell, so I wanted to check on you.
Anzu-dono, you are welcome to join us~♪ You do not have to conceal yourself anymore.

Urgh, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m so sorry! I made you go to such lengths for me...
Abruptly shaking me awake—or, no, just leaving me to rot—would be a much more reasonable course of action!
Please don&#39;t come so close to me! If you associate too heavily with me, my filth will rub off on you!

Hm~? I can&#39;t hear you~

Aaah, please don&#39;t ignore what I&#39;m saying! Stay, stay, Chief![1]

Hehe, you can&#39;t run from me~♪

Ah— Waah!?

Caught you♪
 You refer to yourself as &quot;filthy,&quot; but I do not share that opinion, Mayoi-dono.
 Isn&#39;t it because you bear a pure, clean heart that you cannot accept yourself being anything less than perfect?

N-No. That isn&#39;t true. I&#39;m not the kind of person you believe I am. I&#39;m an even lower, more irrelevant being—

I see. If you say so, Mayoi-dono, I&#39;ll leave it at that.
But as I said before, this was a blunder on my end. Even though I was aware that being in the presence of others causes you great stress, I was unbelievably careless.
You were starting to say so earlier, but it is because of that stress that you became unable to continue working, yes?
You have a strong sense of responsibility. That is why you did not want to give onlookers the impression that the Ninja Association was responsible for causing any issues, correct?

Chief...
 Thank you so very much for not giving up on me, even though I&#39;m so weak...
 B-But I... I just acted selfishly without speaking with you first! I&#39;m incredibly sorry...!

There isn&#39;t any need to apologize. The issue also stemmed from my negligence as your supervisor, didn&#39;t it?
Thus, I have a suggestion... How do you feel about taking charge of the cooking, Mayoi-dono?
 We ninjas are better suited for work in the shadows, aren&#39;t we? Anzu-dono will also check with the owner of the cafe regarding this suggestion♪

Is that really alright...? For me to go back there after all this...

You have no need for hesitation; everyone is awaiting your return.
Nay, what I should be specifying is that no one bears any anger towards you from this event; not I, and not Anzu-dono, Hibiki-dono, or Mashiro-dono either.
Now then, come with me, Mayoi-dono.

...This wasn&#39;t a dead end at all.

A &quot;dead end&quot;? What do you mean by that?
If there is a wall before you, you must simply scale it. That is what a ninja would do.

Chief, I love youuuuuu!

Whoa!? I-I can&#39;t move if you lean all your body weight on me!
Anzu-dono, don&#39;t just laugh, please help me~!

Location: Dead End Café


Ladies and gentlemen, gather &#39;round! I shall now use my sentient hair to make art with white sauce! ♪
One, two, amazing...☆
Hehehe. The dead are also able to control their hair at will, you see! Next, I shall use it to serve your meals~☆

(Yeah, all of the customers&#39; reactions were great... The mood&#39;s not bad at all.)
(But he can&#39;t use theatrics to distract them from the slow service forever...)
(It seems like everyone&#39;s hungry and such... They&#39;d probably prefer character over looks.)
(Hmm, it&#39;s been an hour since Sengoku and Anzu-san left. They should be coming back soon.)
...Huh, is the manager trying to get my attention from the kitchen?
A thumbs up? Erm, now he&#39;s signing to me? So &quot;phone&quot;... An &quot;OK,&quot; and &quot;running&quot;? Does this mean Sengoku and the others are coming back now?
Alright. If so, I&#39;ll be relaying this to Hibiki-senpai with a signal...
(Hibiki-senpai, I think they&#39;re coming back soon!)
(Please hold out juuust a little bit longer!)

(Haha. Could you be trying to say, &quot;I really like you, Hibiki-senpai! You&#39;re so cool! I love you!&quot;...?)
(My, you&#39;re far too kind. Thank you, Tomoya-kun♪ Kiss...☆)

(Uhm, I think there&#39;s a big misunderstanding here?! What the hell was that weird signal I got back?)
(Oh, whatever. This signal I sent can only mean one thing! The rest is up to you, Hibiki-senpai!)

(Hehe. Fret not; I&#39;ve received your message, Tomoya-kun.)
(This is mere child&#39;s play when compared to the feats I had to accomplish in Mrs. Hidaka&#39;s grueling audition.)
(I am a clown who shall fulfill the role expected of him—that&#39;s surely what everyone wishes to see from me, correct?)

Pant, pant... We somehow managed to sneak inside.

There sure is a lot of commotion outside... The line seemed to go on forever, but thankfully we were able to enter through the backdoor without being noticed.

Oh, you&#39;re back! Could you clean yourselves up this instant? We need you guys to help out in the kitchen... There&#39;s been so many customers going in and out since dinner started—the two of us can&#39;t keep up with all the orders!
Right now, Hibiki-senpai&#39;s putting on a show to stall for us. If we can&#39;t get the food out in time, the customers would get upset. We gotta turn the tables before that happens.
Just look at him. He&#39;s been doing that all afternoon.

Here you are. Now, as a member of the dead, I shall employ my powers to make a drink gush out of this cup♪
Everyone agrees that this is an empty cup, yes?
Say it with me: one, two, amazing...☆

No wonder he&#39;s an Eccentric...
Fair is foul, and foul is fair—it is because they&#39;re all so incredible that they cannot hide what makes them irregular. It&#39;s been a while since I was reminded of this fact.

Ahaha. More often than not, he overshadows the lead despite being a supporting actor. That guy likes playing comedic roles.
Actually, with how easily he grabs the spotlight, it&#39;s no wonder why he takes the stage! Seriously... He never ceases to amaze everyone.[1]

Wait, where does he take it to?

No, no. That&#39;s just theater talk for &quot;he&#39;s a really talented guy.&quot; Since Hibiki-senpai can pretty much do anything, there&#39;s no need for him to rely on any gimmicks.
But y&#39;know, you can&#39;t do a one-man show on the grand stage. There&#39;s only one Hibiki-senpai, so of course I have to help him.
We each have our own part to play, and we should be able to do what&#39;s needed of us... Y&#39;know?

Mhm. It&#39;s just as you say.
The same holds true for idols, producers, managers, chefs, servers, customers... No, this goes beyond the restaurant.
There are so many types of people in this world, how fascinating!

Ahaha. Ninjas too. They might be hidden, but they&#39;re always around.
Someone could say that only a handful of geniuses are able to stand on stage, but life would have no meaning then~
Thus, we are called upon the stage. That includes you too, Ayase-senpai♪

Uhmm... I-Is that so?

Ahaha. It sure is~ Otherwise, I&#39;d just slam the door in your face.

Uweh!? Were we not supposed to come back~?

Oh, that&#39;s just an exaggeration. I&#39;m not actually mad or anything of the sort.
Alright, Ayase-senpai. Go clean yourself up and help out in the kitchen.
You can make up for what happened earlier by cooking a good meal for the staff.
Everybody&#39;s been working so hard, after all. It would be such a shame if we didn&#39;t at least get compensated with a warm meal made with love.

Of course. I apologize for the inconvenience, everyone.
I&#39;ll do my best to fulfill my role. I don&#39;t have much confidence in myself, but I can&#39;t bear to disappoint all of you even more.

That&#39;s the spirit. Well then, I&#39;m gonna go check on Hibiki-senpai, so the rest is in your hands.
Same goes to you, Sengoku~

Roger that. Doing behind-the-scenes work is my specialty♪

Take care, Mashiro-san.
...Hm? You&#39;re going to help us too, Miss Producer?
About that... Um... You helping out even though it was all my fault... I&#39;m sorry.
Huh, you&#39;re all prepared!? Since when did you change your clothes!?
All you&#39;ve been doing lately is producer work, so you find this more fun?
Err, someone like myself has no business saying this, but... You&#39;re pretty weird yourself too, huh?
I appreciate it.

(...Hehehe. It appears that it will be smooth sailing from here on out.)
(It&#39;s about time for my curtain call... Perhaps it would be best to wrap things up here?)
(At this rate, we should be able to resolve all the issues begotten of our lack of staff.)
(The café has been rather disorderly for quite a while now, but that, too, should be resolved as soon as Tomoya-kun and I take charge.)
(But, first, I&#39;d best clear up his misunderstandings. Although I am an actor—a single individual—I am also &quot;your&quot; Wataru Hibiki.)
(If you believe that I&#39;d do something as &quot;normal&quot; as only playing one role, perish the thought! I shall play three, four—nay, an infinite amount of them!)
(...If that is what is desired of me by my audience—the you to whom this Wataru Hibiki is dedicated.)
Tomoya-kun!

Y-Yeah? You need something?

There is but one last thing I&#39;d like to request of you. Would you be so kind as to hear me out?

Umm...? Why so sudden? I mean sure, go ahead.

Thank you. ...Very well then! Ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes as I saw Tomoya-kun in half!

Huh?

Hehehe. I suspected something like this may happen, so I even brought along a box and sword for the occasion♪
The tools have already been prepared, so all that&#39;s left is for you to step inside the box...☆

No way in hell. What do you mean that you &quot;suspected something like this may happen&quot;?! And why did you even bring those here, Hibiki-senpai?! We are NOT going to put the &quot;dead end&quot; in &quot;Dead End Café&quot;!

Oh? But I&#39;m certain everyone here would love to see you get sawn in half... Are you really going to refuse them all, Tomoya-kun?

Stop! This isn&#39;t funny! Why are you staring at me like th— AaaaaiiiIIIEEEEEEE?!

Tomoya: Actually, with how easily he grabs the spotlight, it's more accurate to say he's a projectile. Seriously... He never ceases to amaze everyone.
Shinobu: &quot;Projectile&quot;? Such as shuriken and blowguns?
Tomoya: No, no. That's just theater talk for a &quot;colorful&quot; actor. Since Hibiki-senpai can pretty much do anything, there's no need for him to rely on any gimmicks.

A &quot;projectile&quot; is an actor who surprises their audience with how they act, rather than their actual acting ability. A &quot;colorful&quot; actor would be someone who stands out for their unique acting. Both are considered synonyms for each other. The closest English term for this would be a character actor.

After closing hours

Tomoya-kun, what incredible moxie! You had such amazing reactions☆

Ugh, I&#39;m seriously exhausted...
I was genuinely terrified! It doesn&#39;t matter how much of it was just &quot;magic,&quot; I really thought I was gonna have a heart attack!

Hm~ It was because of your dedication to the show that all the customers were able to enjoy it to the fullest, though!
 And so, due to the disorder in the restaurant turning into excitement, we were able to have an extremely satisfying opening event!
It was certainly a performance befitting Dead End Café♪

Could you not involve me in such a dangerous act without letting me know first!?
 You might&#39;ve just been pretending to debate with yourself on whether you&#39;d actually shove that sword right through me or not, but I seriously thought I was gonna die!

Hehehe. If we are to deceive an audience, it simply must be from atop a stage...♪

You can&#39;t pull one over on me by trying to say it like it&#39;s some proverb, okay!?

Um...

Whoa!? Were you here the whole time, Ayase-senpai? I didn&#39;t notice you at all!

Ah, I-I&#39;m sorry for not having much of a presence... Um, as you requested earlier, I prepared some food for the staff; would you like to have some...?
 No, right, you wouldn&#39;t want to go out of your way and eat food that I made, would you!?

Of course I would. Are you having any, Hibiki-senpai?

Certainly~ I am, as one would expect from our series of performances, quite hungry. I will accept with great gratitude.

Ahaha. I shall partake in this meal as well♪ You know, Mayoi-dono is so skillful that he was able to master any dish after only reading the menu~
 This recipe for omurice that he adapted from it is his specialty... I absolutely couldn&#39;t wait to try it♪

Things really do turn out well if you just put the right people in the right jobs, huh?

The show must go on... On stage, whatever will be, will be.
 It is simply inevitable that you will be involved in such predicaments when performing, Tomoya-kun♪

Uh, no. Don&#39;t try to justify your actions from earlier.

F-Feel free to have some as well, Miss Producer... I caused you a great deal of trouble, so at least allow me to treat you to this as an apology...
 I-I hope I&#39;m not being too pushy... Ah, you&#39;re hungry, so you&#39;d be happy to have some? Here you are, then.


I put all my effort into making this. It&#39;s my special omurice.
 Here you go, please enjoy your meal...♪
 Ufufu, I&#39;m so glad... Just watching everyone eat the food I made is enough to save my soul.
 But I truly did a terrible thing to you all... Because of this mess, becoming the Ninja Club feels like a distant dream, and the road ahead is but a long and precipitous path.

And it is fine that way. All&#39;s well that ends well—to travel an even, paved road is unlike a ninja to do.
 The manager looks grateful as well. Though they wondered whether things would turn out all right, this became a good opportunity for publicity, and it seems they had fun, too.

Hehehe. They&#39;ve nerves of steel.
 I suppose that if they didn’t, they wouldn&#39;t be managing a café as odd as this one.

I see. Certainly, to have those that take the stage―or rather, ninjas―manage an event is an eccentric idea to have, but...
 The manager also seems to think that things should be done that way, don&#39;t they?
Surprisingly, I have been told that we may be requested to come back and work here again in the near future. It didn&#39;t sound like they were just saying it to be polite.

R-Really...?
 If that’s the case, I&#39;m glad to hear it...♪
 Though the existence of idols atop a glittering stage has changed my life...
 I told myself that it would be better for me to return to the darkness.
 But it would be tactless of me to say that to the Ninja Association… No, to you all.
 If someone, somewhere out there ever requires our aid, we will rush to wherever they may be. That is what we, as the Ninja Association, do—
 ...Right, Chief? ♪

Season: Winter
Location: Shopping Mall - First Floor


The next day, after school

(Sigh... This ain&#39;t any good. &#39;M not gettin&#39; anywhere...)
(I couldn&#39;t finish the new outfits in time, so we gotta settle with our usual ones fer tomorrow&#39;s live.)
(Even though it&#39;s gonna be Oshi-san&#39;s last performance as part of Valkyrie an&#39; all...)
(But I reckon it&#39;s fine, though Oshi-san used to hate havin&#39; to wear the same outfit over &#39;n over again.)
(We&#39;ve been short on money for a lotta reasons, so this ain&#39;t nothin&#39; new.)
(Those outfits&#39;re the first thing to come to mind when people think of Valkyrie... The fans&#39;ll probably be real happy to see &#39;em.)
(They&#39;re better than the crappy ones I made, anyways.)
(Valkyrie&#39;ll come to an end without mixin&#39; in nothing unnecessary, maintainin&#39; the essence of Oshi-san&#39;s style all the while.)
(And that&#39;s alright. It&#39;s a happy ending... We managed t&#39;make it this far, despite havin&#39; hit rock bottom before.)

Huh? Heeey, Kagehira-senpai! Were you just about to leave?

Ngah? We&#39;ve been seein&#39; each other a real lot lately, Tomoya-kun. Whatcha doin&#39; here? This place&#39;s pretty far from school.
The apartment I&#39;ll be movin&#39; into in spring&#39;s nearby, so I was just checkin&#39; this place out.
I&#39;ve been puttin&#39; it off &#39;til now, but I figured it&#39;s &#39;bout time to start pickin&#39; out furniture.


Ohh, is that so... I&#39;m just a regular shopper~ My family comes to this mall every once in a while.
We just finished buying everything we need, so I&#39;m carrying our stuff to the car.

I see... Ya sure have a lotta bags to carry there.

Yeah... Ah! Wait, I didn&#39;t buy this plush for myself, okay?! My little sister&#39;s just a big fan of President Hibiki...!

Ahaha, nobody&#39;s askin&#39; &#39;bout that. Ain&#39;t it fine, though? Just buy whatever ya like.

Ugh... We tend to get too excited in places like this and end up buying lots of unnecessary things.
The word &quot;sale&quot; is my family&#39;s biggest weakness!

Ah, right. Ya did say yer with yer family. Where&#39;re they, anyways?

Ah, I think they&#39;re looking at the store over there. Can you see them?

Hm...? Sorry, I don&#39;t think I do.

Yep... We&#39;re all &quot;normal,&quot; so we blend right into the crowd.
It&#39;s not the best trait to have as an idol... I envy you, Kagehira-senpai. People have been staring and whispering things about you for quite some time.

Eh? Oh, yer right. There&#39;re some kids pointin&#39; &#39;n squealin&#39; over there.

You just noticed that?

Yeah, I was real deep in thought. Agh, I don&#39;t like bein&#39; stared at...

I heard Valkyrie&#39;s really popular lately, so you&#39;re becoming more famous day by day.
If you&#39;re not in disguise, you&#39;ll cause an uproar in places like this.
You already stand out quite a lot as is.

Err, ya think so? My mismatched eyes really are weird, huh?

No, that&#39;s not it. It&#39;s more like, your eyes are very attractive... Even though I&#39;m a guy, I find you really good-looking! I get the chills every time I watch you perform!
If I were a girl, I&#39;d fall in love with you the moment you start singing!

Whatcha mean by that...? Wait, ya watch our lives? Thank ya kindly~♪

Yeah, I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on you guys for quite a while now. Though, you two only ever pay attention to Nii~chan, I think.
But Valkyrie&#39;s still our number one enemy—a wall we absolutely have to climb over.
There&#39;s no way we&#39;d let ourselves be defeated. No, not just that—I want to make sure that Ra*bits is better than Valkyrie before Nii~chan graduates.

...Ngah?

We have to! Otherwise, it&#39;ll seem like Nii~chan transferring from Valkyrie to Ra*bits was a mistake, right?
He&#39;s always been working so desperately. All the hardships he&#39;s gone through in the course of this year... I don&#39;t want him to think of it as a waste of time.
Sorry to keep talking on and on by myself. But ultimately, that&#39;s why...
In the end, we, Ra*bits, are going to beat Valkyrie one-on-one. At least once.
The Repayment Festival is our last chance we have left to do this...
I don&#39;t know if you guys are performing or not, but it would be great if we can have a showdown there.
If you are, please don&#39;t go easy on us.

...Ya think y&#39;can beat us? Even though yer nothin&#39; but cute lil&#39; bunnies?

But we&#39;re the very bunnies Nii~chan trained for a whole year.
Oh shoot, my family finished shopping before I realized. They&#39;re leaving without me, so I have to go now!

Hey, wait! We ain&#39;t performin&#39; in—
(...Aaand there he goes. Reckon I&#39;ll bump into others if I chase him in this crowd.)
(He sure is quick as a bunny~)
(What was that anyways? Was he tryin&#39; to pick a fight?)
(&quot;Ra*bits beating Valkyrie&quot;? Now that&#39;s a first. There ain&#39;t no way that can happen, yeah? Not when Valkyrie—Oshi-san&#39;s the strongest! He&#39;s invincible!)
(That&#39;s how things should be, but... Honestly, I got a lil&#39; bit scared there...)

    <content><![CDATA[Wow. Wataru? Being a proper senpai? It's more likely than you think.
Phantom Thieves VS Detectives is so dear to me—it's still my favorite event story so far, even after four years. I was able to get permission to TLC this chapter. There's quite a lot of major changes to it, but I had fun!
Series: Ensemble Stars!
Event: Showdown! Magnificent Phantom Thief VS Detective Brigade

Characters: Tomoya Mashiro, Wataru Hibiki
Original TL: appositewhite



Season: Winter
Location: Museum-like Stage


One, two, three, four! Hop, hop, hop♪
...Alright, that&#39;s perfect. Tomoya Mashiro has made a full recovery♪
(Ra*bits were lucky enough to be the main act for today&#39;s live...)
(I gave it my all in order to keep up with everyone else, but I couldn&#39;t show off my strengths.)
(Hajime and Mitsuru are improving at such an incredible rate. They always had more potential than me since the very beginning.)
(I was on break for only a few days, but it&#39;s like I&#39;ve already been left behind.)
(I also need to work harder.)
(The Mystery Stage just reached its turning point. Sena-senpai also said that the &quot;riddles&quot; after today will be even more troublesome.)
(I don&#39;t know if we can successfully crack them like today.)
(I need to be prepared for them by the next time we&#39;re the main act so that I can show-off myself. Nothing will be lost that way.)
(I have to fight tooth and nail. But I can&#39;t become an idol all by myself.)
(In order to take everyone&#39;s hands and move forward, I must go the extra mile.)
(I would be a burden to others if I don&#39;t. No... It&#39;s because I continue standing on the same stage with everyone.)
(I can do it~ I&#39;ll stay after practice for a bit♪)

Are there any naughty children here~? What a pity, there&#39;s only an average child☆

That scared me?! Woah, the Masked Pervert appeared!

Ahaha. Tomoya-kun&#39;s reactions are amusing as usual. It has a rather shocked value to it, hehehe!
How are you? You won&#39;t faint, correct?

I&#39;m not that scared... What, wouldn&#39;t you typically shout &quot;Are you surprised? You&#39;re surprised, aren&#39;t you! How amazing! ☆&quot; with such glee?

Tomoya-kun really can&#39;t imitate me well...
I am much more refined than that! My grace shines through even when I&#39;m spouting nonsense, right?

Go look at a mirror.
Uwah, on closer inspection, you&#39;re wearing some weird costume.
You&#39;re not even participating in the Mystery Stage, so why are you dressed up as a phantom thief?

No, I was thinking of adding something amazing into the mix if the whole unfolding felt boring.
So I made a variety of arrangements, and I&#39;m wearing one right now as a test.
Though, looking at everything that has happened, it looks like my turn will never come.

Yeah, I never thought you&#39;d show up... Err, do you need something from me?

No? I already said that I would stay behind the scenes. I&#39;m here to clean up after the Mystery Stage is over because this auditorium will be used for class tomorrow.
Cleaning it up everyday...
And set everything back up before the show begins. It relies on physical strength more, so I couldn&#39;t ask Miss Anzu to come and help.

So it&#39;s like that, how tiring... Would it be better if I came and helped out?

No, no. I already feel like lecturing you for staying back to practice. It wouldn&#39;t be my problem if you push yourself too hard that you faint again.
Please leave this kind of work to the backstage staff. You should go home immediately and get a good night&#39;s sleep to eliminate your fatigue.
Living life in the fast lane won&#39;t do any good. I know you can&#39;t curb your enthusiasm, but being idle is part of our jobs as idols.

...You saying such wise words[1] feels out of place.

How painful. I always gave you advice in hopes of happy growth and even taught you with such care!
Aaah! This unrequited love is a tragedy that would render even Shakespeare speechless with shock!

Uhm... You&#39;re always helping me improve, even if you are an absolute nutjob.
But to be honest, I can&#39;t really keep up with your footsteps...

Indeed. What is truly a pity is that you&#39;re not Wataru Hibiki. I have forgotten about that and regret it greatly.
However, I shall forget about that in the blink of an eye tomorrow☆

Please keep it in mind a bit longer. Seriously, you&#39;re always saying such careless things...
I still want to practice some more. I don&#39;t want to get in your way, so is it fine if I dance here?

Sure. Don&#39;t mind me, do as you wish. However, if you mess anything up, I&#39;ll use a roundhouse kick to stop you.

Can you be a little more gentle? That roundhouse kick will kill someone. I&#39;m still recovering, so please be careful with me~

What a spoiled child you are.
Well, don&#39;t fret about it. I might have ran into you by chance...
But I won&#39;t get any closer, since I wouldn&#39;t want to hurt you again.
I shall leave right after I&#39;ve finished cleaning up, so please pretend I&#39;m not here.
I am quite inconsiderate and can only protect you by staying away.

Is that so? Then why did you watch today&#39;s show despite saying you&#39;d &quot;stay away&quot; from me?
You were sitting in Row D, Seat 23, right?

Oops, I&#39;ve been found out. My disguise should have been perfect.

Too perfect that it&#39;s unnatural.
The one most unlike you in today&#39;s audience was the guy sitting in Row D, Seat 23.
He was at our S3 too...
Speaking of which, that guy was always around. You&#39;ve been watching over me the whole time, huh? I didn&#39;t expect you to worry that much.

Oh, oh... How embarrassing. This is Wataru Hibiki&#39;s greatest mistake.
Thinking that someone as clueless Tomoya-kun would never see through my disguise, I slacked off, only to fail in the end.

Are you trying to piss me off?

Translation Notes
↑ Localized from &quot;先輩らしいこと&quot; (senpai-like things). Wataru doesn't act like a &quot;proper&quot; senpai most of the time, which is why Tomoya felt off. The relationship between senpai and kouhai is quite important. Adding to that, kouhai usually talk to their senpai using honorific speech, but Tomoya often drops his formalities when talking to Wataru.]]></content>

Season: Summer
Location: Seisou Hall Kitchen


Early September, Seisou Hall

...now, let&#39;s &quot;talk&quot; about &quot;dinosaurs&quot;.

Why dinosaurs...? We&#39;re in the middle of talking about how to split the Creature Clubs&#39; budgets right now—don&#39;t change the subject!

sadly, the &quot;dinosaurs&quot; have all gone &quot;extinct&quot;.

Okay then, so you basically don&#39;t intend to listen to a word I say.

there was a dramatic &quot;change&quot; in the &quot;environment&quot;, caused by a &quot;meteorite&quot; colliding into the earth.
 it&#39;s said that the &quot;dinosaurs&quot; all died out because they couldn&#39;t overcome that change.

Oh, yeah~ I&#39;ve heard of that. The meteorite made dust cover the entire sky, blocking out the sun and causing the Earth to freeze over.
 Since most dinosaurs were cold-blooded, they couldn&#39;t move around in the cold, so they couldn&#39;t hunt for food and eventually starved to death, right?
 But mammals were fine with the cold, because they had fur to keep them warm... or something like that.

you&#39;re so knowledgeable, nazuna.

Nah, I&#39;m just saying what I remember off the top of my head.
More importantly, I can&#39;t see where this discussion is going. What&#39;re you trying to say? What do dinosaurs have to do with how we split the dorm circles&#39; budget?

fufu. kids these days always want to jump to a &quot;conclusion&quot;.

We&#39;re the same age, though~ Don&#39;t start talking like Rei-chin.
If you&#39;re saying something weirdly cryptic to confuse me and make me agree with you, it&#39;s not gonna work.
 As the representative of Creature Club: Animals, I won&#39;t budge.
 In fact, we could have all the money in the world and it still wouldn&#39;t be enough, y&#39;know~ In contrast, you guys at Oceans don&#39;t need much money at all, right?

whose money do you think is used to &quot;purchase&quot; the &quot;fish&quot; and other seafood we eat every day here at &quot;seisou hall&quot;?

Wait, you mean you guys were the ones purchasing the fish we eat at the dorms?

no, the actual purchasing is done by &quot;suppliers&quot;.
 but the &quot;decision&quot; of which &quot;fish&quot; to &quot;buy&quot; is left to us at &quot;oceans&quot;.
also, if we saw any decrease in our &quot;budget allocation&quot;, it would become more difficult to buy more &quot;tanks&quot; for the dorms.
 if that happens, i would be in a worse &quot;mood&quot;, and the &quot;quality&quot; of &quot;fish&quot; we purchase would drop. are you sure you want that?

So it&#39;s a matter of your mood!? We&#39;re talking money right now!
 The Creature Clubs get their budgets from ES under the premise that it&#39;s used for things like the dorms&#39; pet expenses.
 Don&#39;t go wasting it on vague stuff like putting yourself in a better mood or something.

what i&#39;m saying is that using all the &quot;budget&quot; on &quot;land animals&quot; is &quot;unfair&quot;.
 &quot;seisou hall&quot; is very lacking in &quot;moisture&quot; right now, because none of the &quot;budget&quot; is given to us.
 &quot;fish&quot; have &quot;existed&quot; since ancient times long ago, and have survived that which killed the &quot;dinosaurs&quot;...
 they&#39;re the &quot;great elders&quot; of this planet. can&#39;t you show them some more &quot;respect&quot;?

I&#39;m not looking down on fish or anything. But we don&#39;t need to go as far as cutting down on pet expenses, which are absolutely necessary, just to get more tanks to keep fish in.

the &quot;creature clubs&quot; get a &quot;lot more&quot; money in their &quot;budget&quot; than necessary...
so i&#39;m asking if &quot;oceans&quot; can get even just a little bit more of it.

No means no! I can&#39;t give you guys what we don&#39;t have, and the current budget split is just fine!

ehh~? that&#39;s unfair! that&#39;s favoritism! does having a &quot;fur pelt&quot; really make you so much more &quot;important&quot;?

Hmmm~? But we do need to save up extra money, just in case someone&#39;s pet gets sick or something...
...!?

mn? what&#39;s the matter, nazuna?
 please don&#39;t make that &quot;face&quot;. i got &quot;worked up&quot; and reacted a little too &quot;harshly&quot;, okay? i&#39;m sorry.

O-Oh, no, that&#39;s okay, I understand how you feel, Kanata-chin. But that&#39;s not—just, leave that for later and look! Look, over there!

look at what...?

...? that&#39;s someone from &quot;oceans&quot;—
the lover of &quot;shrimp&quot;, izumi.

Yeah, and our Tomo-chin is there too. What are they doing? They&#39;re walking so close to each other...

yes, as if they&#39;re a &quot;couple&quot;~♪

Yeah, you&#39;re right—they&#39;re being kinda weird, huh!? C-Could it be that... that Izumi-chin isn&#39;t satisfied with just Mako-chin, and now he&#39;s subjecting Tomo-chin to his torment?

Season: Summer
Location: Florence, Italy


At the same time, in Florence

And hey presto, illusion complete! Yay~! ♪

......

Ha-ha-ha, just the thought of Nazunyan&#39;s face all panicked and freaked out is enough to make me laugh!
Oh, that feels so good—that&#39;s what you get for treating someone like a straight up criminal♪
I wonder if I should mess with him a little more. What if I sent him a message with something like, &quot;If you want To-mo-ya-kun back, pay me a ransom fee...&quot;
...Do you think he&#39;d actually get the police involved if I did?

......

Hey now, To-mo-ya-kun, what&#39;s with that look on your face? Cheer up, won&#39;t you? We made a clean getaway from that hoard of zombies, and look, we&#39;re no longer handcuffed together. So why the long face...?

Yeah... For some reason, Hibiki-senpai had it. The key, I mean.
I&#39;m telling you—that guy definitely stole the key and sneakily hid it away somewhere, then stood back to watch and laugh at our distress.

But he also acted as a decoy for us to lure Nazunyan&#39;s hoard of zombies away from us, so what&#39;s the problem?
Think of it as give-and-take. I&#39;m not fan of how the saying goes but, as they say, &quot;No man is an island~&quot; ♪

Ugh~... But in the end, the two of us just danced along to the beat of Hibiki-senpai&#39;s script from start to finish. Doesn&#39;t that irritate you?
All because I asked him to teach me some magic tricks...
Which means he also taught me how to use him as a decoy and escape using misdirection.

Misdi...what?

Misdirection. It&#39;s when you draw attention to one thing, then in the meantime, you sneakily do a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes. It&#39;s one of the fundamentals of magic.

So in this case, you used Hibiki in your misdirection, so you could successfully pull off the escape stunt?

Yes. He should&#39;ve just told me from the start!
Instead, he went through all this trouble to make sure I was backed right up against the wall, so I had no choice but to go all out. He had me wrack my brains and waited for me to come up with this escape plan all by myself, while he stood back with a stupid grin on his face!

Ha-ha. When you explain something with words alone, there&#39;s no guarantee that you&#39;ll get the hang of it. You&#39;ve got to think things through yourself, then repeat the process of trial and error until you get it right.
We aren&#39;t geniuses that can hit the nail on the head from the start, after all♪

You&#39;re in awfully high spirits, Sena-senpai. Are you really that happy about showing Nii~chan and the others who&#39;s boss?

Yeah. Besides, we&#39;re finally free from those wretched handcuffs. It&#39;s only natural that I can&#39;t keep this grin off of my face, isn&#39;t it?
I think I&#39;ve finally understood firsthand just how awful it is to have your freedom taken from you. I&#39;m making a vow—I swear I&#39;ll never abduct anyone against their will ever again.

You don&#39;t really need to say that so proudly, though. Most people already know that sort of thing is unacceptable—you don&#39;t have to go through the trouble of putting it into words. It&#39;s kinda scary...

Ha-ha. But even if I do scare you, you&#39;ve got nowhere to escape to, have you, To-mo-ya-kun? This is my turf now—even if you go running to the police, you won&#39;t be able to do much because of the language barrier. Checkmate!

Ugh, I can&#39;t believe the very first trip abroad in my life ended up like this... It&#39;s fine though, not like I had any immediate plans.

Exactly. The two of us have plenty of time to kill, so we might as well spend it productively, hmm? ♪
I&#39;ll show you around. We&#39;ve got some time to fritter away before Nazunyan and the others get wind of the situation and call off their &quot;Idol Of The Dead&quot; farce.

Yeah. If we&#39;d stayed in Japan, we&#39;d just get chased by zombies forever. But well, there&#39;s no way those guys would go as far as chasing us overseas.

Right. These cuff marks alone are enough to stir up a fuss if anyone catches sight of them, but I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d begin to explain bite marks from a zombie.
This is a far more refined use of our time, at least until the excitement dies down over there♪

I get it. But I seriously wasn&#39;t prepared to hop overseas at all, so all I&#39;ve got with me are the clothes on my back. I&#39;ve got to rely on you for everything else, Sena-senpai—a change of clothes, food, and accommodation. So uh, please don&#39;t take off without me.


I know, I know. You let me stay in your room last night, so I&#39;ll at least return the favor there. That said, who knows what&#39;ll happen after that...?
Let&#39;s take this bizarre episode and call it an experience, something we can learn to grow from, even by a little. Just like any ordinary creature that can be found anywhere else in the world.

Got it. Aha-ha. Just making it through life is an experience in itself...♪

A few minutes later, Seisou Hallway

W-W-What are we gonna to do now, Sena-senpai!?
This isn&#39;t how you said things would go! You swore that it&#39;d be too early for anyone to see us!
But now we&#39;ve been caught red-handed! And by Nii~chan of all people!

Haaa!? Could you watch it with the &quot;Nii~chan&quot; so close to my ear? It&#39;s getting me weirdly excited!

What even!? Ugh, what is with this guy...!?

Oh, pipe down! Can you not start freaking out just because things didn&#39;t go exactly as planned? It&#39;s sooo annoying!
It&#39;s not like I have psychic powers or something, okay? I&#39;m not God!
Besides, the important thing is being able to deal with it when everything doesn&#39;t go according to plan—well? Am I wrong!?

Urgh...! It&#39;s not that anything you&#39;re saying is wrong, it&#39;s just that—for some reason, it&#39;s hard to agree when you&#39;re the one saying it, Sena-senpai!

And what the hell is that supposed to mean!? Why is it that not one person around here listens to a word I say? It&#39;s not every day you come across someone like me, who&#39;s practically always right about everything!

Just now! I heard a voice coming from over here...!

yes! they were talking about something to do with &quot;god&quot;. i do feel like this is a very &quot;ominous&quot; sign indeed... it could be just as you feared—

What&#39;s with that grim look on your face all of a sudden!? Do you have any idea why the two of them are acting so suspiciously?
Nngh, even so... I&#39;d really thought that scoundrel Izumi-chin—had calmed down a lot recently, so to speak!
Could it be I just haven&#39;t heard anything about what he&#39;s been up to while I&#39;ve been at college and he&#39;s been overseas!?
Argh, what do I do? What do you do in a situation like this? Call the police!?
What am I supposed to say? &quot;Sir, I would like to report that my son has been kidnapped by a pervert&quot;!?

nooo, that would be making a far bigger &quot;ordeal&quot; out of this than necessary! we should prioritize confirming the &quot;facts&quot; and proceed with &quot;prudence&quot;!

Uh, proceed with what now? Y&#39;know, sometimes I haven&#39; godda glue what d&#39; heg you&#39;re trynna say—not that I&#39;ve got any right to talk!
Well, whatever! If we wanna get to the bottom of this, we&#39;ve gotta grab ahold of Izumi-chin and Tomo-chin!
I&#39;ll go wake up a bunch of guys we can trust—once I let them know what&#39;s going on, they can help us out!

alright! we shall make use of a &quot;human wave attack&quot; to track down izumi!
of course, i&#39;ll help you out, nazuna. i can&#39;t turn back now; that &quot;ship&quot; has already set sail. in return, about our clubs&#39; budgets—

We&#39;ll come back to that later! Temporary truce for now! All that matters to me at the moment, Kanata-chin, is rescuing Tomo-chin from Izumi-chin&#39;s evil clutches!

alright! please set your mind at ease, nazuna! &quot;justice&quot; will always prevail in the end!

Tch!? Urgh!? Grr!?

*whisper* P-Please calm down, Sena-senpai! Otherwise they&#39;ll find us! And while we&#39;re at it, if you keep yanking me around like this, my wrist is going to be in so much pain!

No—he—how could he!? Nazunyan, of all people—Nazunyan, of all people!
There was absolutely no need for him to call me a—a pervert! He called me a pervert!? Has he always thought of me that way, all this time?

N-Nii~chan just has a bit of a sharp tongue when he gets all riled up! If he says anything offensive, please just laugh it off!
More importantly! We should focus on getting ourselves somewhere no one else is going to be around, before Nii~chan and the others spot us!

That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m trying to do! Can you quit your whining? If you&#39;ve got somewhere to go, then go! Go on, shoo!

But I can&#39;t—that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to tell you! You&#39;re just like Nii~chan—getting all riled up and completely forgetting your surroundings!
Pleeease try to remember: you and I are acting as one right now! If one of us goes somewhere, the other has to go too! There&#39;s no way around it!

I know. Why are you telling me something I am already aware of. Oh, you think I&#39;m some kind of idiot, do you!?

Aargh, this guy is impossible! He keeps twisting my words and assumes the worst!
I&#39;ve never been around an upperclassman that acted like this before, so I have no idea what to do! Not like I don&#39;t have others who are troublesome in a different way to deal with though!

What&#39;s this about!? Who am I a disappointment to in comparison?

N-Nobody said anything like that!?

That&#39;s what it sounded like to me! I knew it, you think I&#39;m some dumbass who can&#39;t even tell when he&#39;s being insulted, don&#39;t you!? I can tell from the way you treat me!
Argh, I&#39;ve had it! This is sooo ridiculous! Why do I have to be handcuffed to some annoying kid I barely know!?

Ow, ow, ow!? The handcuffs are chafing my wrist! Will you please just calm down, Sena-senpai? No matter how much of a fuss you make, it&#39;s not going to get us anywhere!

Turning back time, the day before The Abduction Of Tomoya Mashiro ft. Izumi Sena

(Argh, why is it so damn hot!? It&#39;s so freaking clammy and humid that I feel like I&#39;ve stepped right into hell! This sucks!)
(This is exactly why I hate this country! I knew that escaping overseas was the right idea! There may be a whole crowd making fun of me now, but they&#39;ll all see the value in my decision once we reach the afterlife for sure!)
(I can already see them—ten or twenty years from now, even Kasa-kun and Naru-kun are going to come crawling back to me with their heads bowed low. &quot;I was wrong!&quot; they&#39;ll grovel—mark my words!)
(Even though right now they—along with our fans—can&#39;t wrap their heads around why I took off overseas so suddenly!)
(That was part of my plan all along! As if I&#39;d turn around now and put a dent in my perfectly constructed future plans!)
(Whoever came up with the idea of constructing this stupid building without bothering to give me a heads up is in the wrong here!)
(It&#39;s all their fault! And now they&#39;re all &quot;You guys need to get a clue!&quot; to people like me and Nazunyan, who&#39;ve already thought about which path to take—as we should!—and made our preparations—mn?)
(What&#39;s this? Some colorful hoops just rolled over and landed by my feet? Is there some kind of paranormal activity going on here...?)

Oh god, sorry about that! Those are mine!

Mn? And who are you? Uh—right, you&#39;re one of the kids from Nazunyan&#39;s unit, aren&#39;t you?

Wait, you don&#39;t remember who I am?
Even though we&#39;ve performed together multiple times? It&#39;s me, Tomoya Mashiro from Ra*bits! Thanks for always having our back!

I don&#39;t remember...not doing anything for you, I suppose.
That&#39;s right, I looked after you during Mystery Stage and the school festival, didn&#39;t I? Even though it&#39;s not as if I have hours of free time to waste!

Uh? Huh? Why are you in such a bad mood? Did I say something that rubbed you the wrong way?

No, it&#39;s not your fault, uh... To-mo-ya-kun. I&#39;m in a bad mood because of the ridiculous Grossness Index of this country!

Oh yeah, it&#39;s been crazy hot lately.
And to make matters worse, since the ES building wants to show everyone they&#39;re doing their part in energy conservation, they&#39;ve turned off the AC anywhere it&#39;s unnecessary.
There aren&#39;t normally a lot of people around this area, so it&#39;s boiling hot and you get all sweaty just from walking around.
In order to avoid heatstroke, you&#39;ve gotta drink plenty of water.

......

...? W-What is it? Is there something on my face?

No, I was just thinking everything out of your mouth is so mind-numbingly ordinary... You&#39;re saying meaningless stuff I already know, and I&#39;ve already forgotten what you&#39;ve said despite standing right next to you.

Don&#39;t call me ordinary!
Wait, I mean—it&#39;s kinda like a trigger word for me, so I&#39;d appreciate it if you didn&#39;t use it—it sort of sets me off!

Excuse me? Why is some small-fry who&#39;ll start wailing to the extent he&#39;ll get &quot;set off&quot; lecturing me about my behavior? Could you not? Who do you think you are?

I&#39;d love to ask you the same thing... Are you royalty or an aristocrat or something, Sena-senpai?

Hmph. For the record, knights can also be considered nobility or a privileged class depending on the country and time period, you know~?

A knight... Well, I guess you are part of Knights, Sena-senpai. You&#39;ve got a point...
Um, are you here in Japan because you&#39;ve got some Knights-related work?

That&#39;s right. Up until yesterday we had a live tour kinda thing, and a week from now we&#39;ve got to do a bunch of promotional stuff related to that, so I&#39;ve heard.
And so, in the meantime I&#39;ve got the week off.
Going to and fro between countries is a pain in the ass, and the time difference throws off my circadian rhythm, which is so bad for my skin...
These days whenever I&#39;ve got time off, I&#39;ve just been staying out here instead of heading back to Florence.
Not like I&#39;ve got much work back in Florence anyway. But I can&#39;t let the other members of Knights know that, it&#39;s embarrass—or rather—I feel like they might make a dumb joke out of it.
So I only pretend to head back to Florence and just keep myself to places I won&#39;t run into anyone I know as much as possible. I normally crash at Leo-kun&#39;s folks&#39; place.

Leo-kun... You mean, Tsukinaga-senpai? Aren&#39;t the two of you close though? Is it okay for him to know about your weird behavior?

That guy listens to whatever I say, so if I tell him to keep something to himself, he won&#39;t breathe a word to anyone else.
Besides, nothing about the image he has of me is even worth preserving... not anymore.
Anyway. Hey now, are you sure it&#39;s alright for you to be chit-chatting with me like this, To-mo-ya-kun?
Ra*bits seem to be fairly popular, so shouldn&#39;t you be relatively busy right now?

Oh... It&#39;s the same as before for us, &quot;no rest for the weary!&quot;
In order to gain some recognition from our agency, Rhythm Link, which has a long history, we&#39;ve gotta push ourselves as hard as we can to see some results.
So recently we&#39;ve been crazy busy taking on both solo and unit work whenever we can.
Even though I don&#39;t have any great talents or anything, I&#39;ve still gotta try my best at everything I can.
It&#39;s so stressful! The project I&#39;m wrapped up in at the moment feels like a train wreck already!

Mn? What do you mean?

Well, um. It seems as though Hibiki-senpai&#39;s introduced me on some TV show as his &quot;number one apprentice.&quot; But the TV show in question actually turned out to be one that features magic.
So now there&#39;s this big misunderstanding that I can do magic tricks just as well as him.
I can&#39;t, though! It&#39;s true that he&#39;s been teaching me a lot, but about acting, not magic.
Besides, I don&#39;t want to be seen as that guy&#39;s &quot;apprentice,&quot; I want to be seen as his equal, his rival...
Even though considering my current abilities, or lack thereof, that probably sounds like a load of nonsense.

......

...Sena-senpai? Were you even listening to me?

Huh? Oh, were you talking to me?

Who else would I be talking to? There&#39;s no one else here! Besides, weren&#39;t you the one who started the conversation~?

But it&#39;s not like you and I are close enough to talk about things like this in the first place, To-mo-ya-kun.
If you need an agony aunt to pour your heart out to, you should be going to Hibiki or Nazunyan.
I happen to be extremely busy picking out a delicious beverage in order to appease even a smidgeon of my irritation.
Idols can take any of these drinks for free, right?

Oh, yes. That sounds right. You can drink as much as you want free of charge, but as a result none of the drinks here are particularly good.

Yeah, I can see that, huh. Talk about cheaping out with the drink bar...
Everything looks packed with sugar and atrocious for your health. So you&#39;re telling me there&#39;s not one drink here that&#39;s good for beauty?

Ahaha. If that&#39;s the kind of drink you&#39;re after, you&#39;d be better off heading to the café inside the main building.

Mm... But then I&#39;d have to pay using L$, wouldn&#39;t I? If I were to do that, there would be a record that I&#39;ve been loitering around here instead of heading back to Italy.
That said, I feel like it would be a total waste to pay with yen.

Ahaha, Hajime said something similar before. That guy will do every conceivable thing he can think of to make something cheaper by even a single cent. If anything, I&#39;ve got a lot of respect for that side of him.

Oh, Hajime Shino from Ra*bits... He&#39;s in the same unit as you, so you&#39;re close?
I do envy you. Just about everyone in my unit can be ridiculously cheeky to me, would you believe?
Especially lately, we&#39;ve been butting heads a lot, and the atmosphere always feels prickly. I&#39;m fairly jealous of Nazunyan&#39;s lot—everything seems to be so calm and peaceful all the time.
Is there a knack to it? No, it could just simply be a matter of personalities...
Unlike the brats in my unit, from what I can see, Hajime-kun and the others seem to be obedient, well-behaved kids, right?

F-From the sound of things, you don&#39;t have any trouble remembering who Hajime is. Even though it seems like you completely forgot who I am.

That kid&#39;s famous lately, isn&#39;t he? What with being marketed as a duo along with that prominent something-or-other from the same agency.

Oh, you mean Bishoujo-senpai... So that person is famous overseas too?

Not sure if I&#39;d call them &quot;famous&quot;... More like, they stand out pretty noticeably, and not always in a good way. Rather like me. So you could say they left an impression on me.

Oh wow... For some reason, I&#39;m kinda jealous.

Mn? Of what?

I was just thinking there&#39;s nothing about me that would stand out in such a way that I&#39;d get people talking about me like that.
When you&#39;re surrounded by colorful people while you&#39;re plain and average and ordinary, that can actually become a quirk in itself, I guess.
But I really wish there was something unique about me, something that only I can bring to the table... I wish I had some sort of merit or skill to be praised for, or make others envious.
When you say the name Tomoya Mashiro, you immediately think of this! Something like that that others could look up to and even try to imitate...
It seems like my quirk is just being &quot;ordinary,&quot; but it&#39;s not like anyone&#39;s out there like, &quot;Man, I wish I was as ordinary as him!&quot;
Hajime, Mitsuru, and everyone else are evolving at an exponential rate and really making an impact, so I guess I&#39;m sorta panicking and worrying about myself a whole lot.
Our agency also seems to be at a loss for how to promote me...
They took advantage of the rumor that I&#39;m good at magic and asked me to do some magic tricks on some TV show.
They figured that if I can pull off something impressive and things end up going well, that could become my thing.
So like, even though it was all based on a big misunderstanding, I felt kinda flattered that they had high expectations for me.
Besides, back when Nii~chan was about to make his official return to the group, I was kinda aggressive towards them and kicked up a bit of a fuss, so I don&#39;t really wanna go against our agency&#39;s wishes right now if I can help it—
So I just went ahead and accepted the invitation to appear on that TV show without really thinking it through. And now I seriously regret it.
There&#39;s no way I can master any seriously impressive magic in such a short amount of time.
For the record, I did suck it up and beg Hibiki-senpai to give me some guidance. And I&#39;m using whatever free time I have to practice as hard as I can, like I&#39;m doing right now. But I just don&#39;t seem to be improving.
I feel like I&#39;m going needlessly out of my way, and I&#39;m just wasting my own time—

......

Oh, sorry! I&#39;ve been rambling about something that has nothing to do with you, Sena-senpai.

No, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s one way for me to kill time.
And precisely because it has nothing to do with me, I don&#39;t feel so much as an iota of stress listening to you go on. You&#39;re talking about a world a million miles away from me.
Besides. I don&#39;t exactly dislike hard-working kids such as yourself.
If anything, now I&#39;m itching to lend a hand. Lately I haven&#39;t been able to lend any support to Yuu-kun nor Kasa-kun, so I&#39;m kind of frustrated—
I&#39;m kind of warming to idea of becoming your kind-hearted, beloved &quot;Onii~chan,&quot; To-mo-ya-kun...♪

Y-You&#39;re not my big brother though, Sena-senpai!? Not under any circumstances!
Ohhh god—the way you got all excited just now is giving me the same stench as the Masked Pervert!

We return to the day of The Abduction Of Tomoya Mashiro ft. Izumi Sena

After that, for some reason, you ended up lending me a hand, Sena-senpai.
You stood in as a member of the audience, and I practiced some magic in front of you.

Yeah. That&#39;s one of the fundamentals of any craft, be it magic, idol work, modeling, or whatever else.
When you hole yourself up and practice something alone, you develop bad habits—which ends up rendering all the time you spent not just pointless, but outright harmful.
When it comes to improving, what you need is someone to scrutinize and evaluate your performance, and then offer you the guidance to proceed in the right direction.
I just happened to have slightly more free time than I know what to do with, and I have excellent taste no matter the field, so I was perfect for the job! ♪

Ughh... You sounded so sure of yourself and weirdly confident that I just took you at your word, without so much as a second thought.
I was even about to completely reevaluate my opinion of you. Like, &quot;Wow, maybe Sena-senpai&#39;s actually pretty kind~♪&quot;

What do you mean &quot;maybe&quot;? I&#39;m always kind, aren&#39;t I? Did you forget all those times I had your back last year!?

No, uh. This is kind of hard to say but, basically all you did was criticize me, Sena-senpai. I don&#39;t remember you giving me any real guidance or support.

Excuse me? Criticism is essential, isn&#39;t it? Back when I was studying ballet, my instructor would constantly lambast me to the point that it was dehumanizing!

Oh... So that experience shaped who you are today, Sena-senpai...
I&#39;m totally fine with being treated like trash, but I think you should be kinder to the rest of your juniors.
Positive encouragement seems to be the best motivation to grow as a person.

But look here: to put it bluntly, I didn&#39;t have a single thing to praise you for, To-mo-ya-kun. You&#39;re obviously a novice at magic, and every single move you made was just stiff and awkward and clumsy.
I&#39;m no magician, but I could still tell you were crap. You made it pretty obvious how all of your tricks were done. It was just painful to watch, don&#39;t you agree?

Ugh... It sounds like I&#39;m just making excuses, but I swear I was way better when I was practicing by myself!
But the way you kept staring at me with that piercing gaze made me weirdly nervous—

Hmm? Well, I do happen to be incredibly beautiful, but there&#39;s nothing I can do about that♪

It was more like, I was terrified that you&#39;d start scolding me no matter what I did.

I don&#39;t particularly intend to scold you. For the most part, I have nothing but support for hard-working kids.
Giving you straightforward critiques was simply me doing everything in my power to help you out—wouldn&#39;t you see that as an expression of my kindness?

But you didn&#39;t just stop at critiques alone, you&#39;d want to physically get involved too...
When I was practicing that escape stunt, you insisted that I &quot;let you try, just this once.&quot;

Well, it looked easy enough to me.

No, it&#39;s super difficult! I&#39;m using real handcuffs for this escape stunt, like the ones the police use!
The whole point of the trick is to escape from something unescapable! That&#39;s what makes people go &quot;Whoa!&quot; or &quot;Amazing!&quot;

Well, I suppose... If handcuffs were easy to escape from, the police wouldn&#39;t always be using them to apprehend criminals, huh.
But still. They just looked like a pair of cheap and flimsy toys. On the off chance something went wrong, I figured it would be easy to bust out of them.

Excuse this, excuse that... What are you, a little kid?
Oh god, I&#39;m so sorry for being so cheeky to you, Sena-senpai!

No, it&#39;s fine. A touch of rebelliousness is cute. You&#39;re the child of someone who &quot;has a sharp tongue when he gets all riled up,&quot; aren&#39;t you, To-mo-ya-kun?

Ughh... Sorry, I guess I&#39;m also kinda losing it, thanks to this bizarre situation.

Yeah. Who would have thought amidst the chaos of trying to get the handcuffs off we&#39;d end up like this?

Yeah. On top of the two of us being handcuffed together—

—We can&#39;t get the handcuffs off, either. But why? Didn&#39;t you have a key ready? Isn&#39;t it normal to have a key ready?

I&#39;ve told you over and over again, we were so flustered trying to get the handcuffs off that I guess I lost the key in the scuffle.
So I think I might&#39;ve dropped it in the same place I was practicing magic yesterday.

Worst case scenario, one of the cleaning staff handed it in. But are you certain that was really when you lost the key?
We searched all over that room yesterday until late at night, but couldn&#39;t find it anywhere.

Right, I know... That&#39;s what makes it such a mystery. I know I had a key ready, but it just disappeared.

Well, it didn&#39;t just disappear. You definitely just dropped it somewhere, or put it away in your pocket and forgot about it, I&#39;m telling you.

That&#39;s what I believe too, and yet... While we were retracing our steps god knows how many times yesterday, we ended up running out of time.
We were making such a fuss that the security guards and other staff in the building came over to investigate...
Then you insisted that you &quot;couldn&#39;t be seen like this!&quot; and started dragging me away to flee the scene.

Well, I didn&#39;t have a choice in the matter. I&#39;ve already said this before, but I do not want the rest of Knights to know that I&#39;ve been staying out here instead of flying back to Italy.
Not to mention, if they saw me handcuffed to a cute younger boy, there&#39;d probably be a big misunderstanding that I&#39;m up to some funny business like kidnapping all over again.

It actually did seem like Nii~chan had that kind of misunderstanding when he saw us. Though I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll understand if we explain the situation to him.

No, no! When blood rushes to Nazunyan&#39;s head, he won&#39;t listen to a word from anyone around him! And I have my doubts whether Shinkai is capable of a sensible conversation in the first place.

Not that it matters, but why were those two together anyways? They&#39;re a pretty unusual pair.

Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care. Never mind what anyone else is up to—all that matters right now is sorting ourselves out, right?

Anyway, we&#39;ve gotta do something about this situation ASAP. Before anyone sees us and causes a commotion, if possible.
It&#39;s about time for everyone to get here, too, so we&#39;d better hurry... Though last night we did manage to hide ourselves in your dorm room, since it was empty for some reason.

Yeah... My roommate, Ayase-senpai, hardly shows up at all for some reason. I sometimes feel his presence from inside the ceiling, though.

I don&#39;t know this Ayase person, but you&#39;re saying there&#39;s another weirdo here now? What is this place, a weirdo factory?

Ayase-senpai says and does weird things sometimes, but he&#39;s a good person. Probably.
Anyway, let&#39;s focus on getting out of these handcuffs as quickly as possible. At this rate, it&#39;ll get in the way of our daily lives.

I&#39;ve learned that the hard way. Not getting to use one of my hands is already enough of a pain, and neither of us wants to be stuck together until the day we die, right?

Yeah. You keep complaining whenever I try to do anything too, and it feels like I&#39;m gonna have a nervous breakdown any second now...
Uh, or rather, you wouldn&#39;t be able to go back to Italy still handcuffed to me.

Yeah, I doubt they&#39;d let me through airport security looking like this.
We&#39;ll just have to do something about this before anyone finds us. Where were you practicing your magic trick? We should try looking there first.

Before that, I wanna get some food... I&#39;ve skipped a few meals since yesterday because of this whole situation, so I&#39;m starving.
Maybe I should&#39;ve brought some snacks from my dorm room...

Haha. Boys your age sure have to eat a lot, don&#39;t they, To-mo-ya-kun? Maybe it&#39;s because we&#39;re practically attached to each other right now, but I can hear your tummy rumbling♪

What? My tummy wasn&#39;t rumbling, though?

Aww, come on, there&#39;s no need to be shy. Didn&#39;t we take a bath together last night? We&#39;re practically besties♪

I-It&#39;s not like I had a choice, and I tried my best not to look in your direction—
Wait, huh? I just heard a noise that sounded like a hungry stomach, too. Was that you, Sena-senpai?

Excuse me? As if I would ever make such an unflattering noise in public!

Speaking of unflattering, how are we gonna use the toilet like this...? We barely managed to take a bath, but it&#39;d be impossible to avoid things when using the toilet, right?

Don&#39;t think of that right now! As long as we somehow get out of these handcuffs before we can&#39;t take it anymore, we won&#39;t have to worry about that, okay? I&#39;m saying we should take action before that! Don&#39;t you understand!?

Ughh, why do you get all snappy so quickly? The way you&#39;re saying it makes it sound like all of this is my fault~!

And it&#39;s true! If you hadn&#39;t practiced that magic trick where I could see you, none of this would—

Uuuurrrggghhh!

Gyyaaaaaaagh!?

Ahaha, didn&#39;t you just say you wouldn&#39;t make unflattering noises, Sena-senpai?

I-I-I couldn&#39;t help it, okay!? Hey you, you orange mop! What&#39;s with you all of a sudden? Don&#39;t scare us like that!

Uuurrghh, urrraaaghh—

Wh-What is that? Some sort of impression? I get that you&#39;re the one who&#39;s been making weird noises all this time, but...?

(...Oops, better hide the handcuffs before he sees them.)
(Ughh. Hiding the handcuffs like this makes me feel like I&#39;m on TV with the subtitles saying, &quot;The culprit is finally being arrested!&quot; or something...)
(Just what crime did we commit to get ourselves in this mess?)

Wh—To-mo-ya-kun! Don&#39;t just stand there daydreaming, do something about this orange mop! Ra*bits and Trickstar are friends and stuff, right!?

......?

Urrraaagh♪

Eeek!? Wh-Why are you clinging on to me, Akehoshi-senpai!? Stop, Hokuto-senpai and Hajime&#39;ll get mad at me...!

Grraaaaarrrghh!

Raaaaaaughh~ as they say♪

Huh? What? Oogami-senpai and Sengoku—wh-what&#39;s going on? Why are you coming towards us while making weird noises!?

It looks like they&#39;re not the only ones being weird, though...?

Bleeeaaagh, raaarrgh.

Uh, ungghh? Uhhhhgghh—

Eep, there&#39;s people acting weirdly coming from downstairs, too!

Yep, and even people like Kao-kun who wouldn&#39;t usually join in on annoying pranks like this are here... H-Hang on, this is so weird that it&#39;s actually starting to creep me out...

Urrrrghh—

Eeep!? Th-This guy just tried to bite me! Stop it, Akehoshi-senpai, I thought you were nice!?

&quot;Ding dong ding dong♪&quot;

......?

&quot;This is a public service announcement. There is currently a special event being held in the ES Building—Idol of the Dead.&quot;

Mmn? Idol of the what now? That&#39;s Nazunyan&#39;s voice, isn&#39;t it?

Yeah, it is. It&#39;s been a while, getting to hear Nii~chan&#39;s voice over the speakers like this...♪

Some minutes later

Fufufu♪ Now Izumi-chin&#39;s as good as a rat in the bag!

yes! it&#39;ll be as easy as cheezumi~[1]

Yeah? Uh... Yeah, I guess?

fufufu. looks like &quot;oceans&quot; scored the &quot;first goal&quot;.

That&#39;s not in the rules! We&#39;re not having a pun competition~!
Idol of the Dead is a full-scale war between Animals and Oceans!
Whichever side wins gets to decide how to split the next Creature Club budget!

that&#39;s right. it was &quot;unproductive&quot; to &quot;argue&quot; about it endlessly, after all~
the more time we &quot;waste&quot; arguing, the longer the creatures go &quot;hungry&quot;.
that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to decide this with a one-off &quot;competition&quot;.

The rules are simple! Whoever catches Izumi-chin first, wins!

yes, so we&#39;re basically playing a game of &quot;tag&quot;~♪
although it feels more like an &quot;activity&quot; for the &quot;asobi club&quot; rather than the &quot;creature club&quot;, doesn&#39;t it?

That&#39;s fine! We&#39;ll deal with this while everyone thinks we&#39;re just playing a game! That&#39;s why I went and got permission from ES management to make that broadcast just now!
&quot;An unprecedented zombie hazard has broken out in the ES building...!&quot;
&quot;Can the sole survivors, Tomoya Mashiro and Izumi Sena, successfully escape from the approaching zombie horde!?&quot;
—That&#39;s the setting we&#39;re going with for this elaborate game of tag! We&#39;ll film it, edit it, and stream it online or something!
That&#39;s &quot;Idol of the Dead&quot;! This way, no one will think we&#39;re being weird even if we make a big scene chasing them!

mhm. it&#39;s in the &quot;building&quot; and not &quot;seisou hall&quot;, after all. there are people working as usual here, too, so we needed an &quot;excuse&quot;.

Yeah. We&#39;re gonna settle this privately before the cops show up to investigat\e~ After all, we still don&#39;t know if Izumi-chin&#39;s really committed a crime.

but, why &quot;zombies&quot;? our &quot;circles&quot; were formed to take care of &quot;living creatures&quot;, so aren&#39;t they the &quot;complete opposite&quot; of what the &quot;creature clubs&quot; are for?

It&#39;s just &#39;cause I watched a movie like that last night. It&#39;s not like I could&#39;ve come up with a great idea like this at such short notice, y&#39;know~...?
Besides, do you know why zombies attack humans, Kanata-chin?

huh? isn&#39;t it because they&#39;re hungry?

Nope! Zombies don&#39;t seem to die naturally from starvation, but they still target humans relentlessly! Why&#39;s that?
It&#39;s because they&#39;re jealous of the living! They have a maddening desire to extend their own lives!
Zombies&#39; obsession with the concept of living corresponds exactly to what the Creature Clubs stand for! You think so too, don&#39;t you Kanata-chin...!?

nazuna, you haven&#39;t &quot;slept&quot; much, have you? you&#39;re acting strangely. and you say you watched a scary &quot;movie&quot;, huh...?
if that&#39;s the case, then it&#39;s &quot;reasonable&quot; that you couldn&#39;t sleep. could it be that you&#39;re being extra aggressive today because you didn&#39;t get enough &quot;sleep&quot; and don&#39;t have &quot;room to breathe&quot;? ♪

Well, that too, but I just couldn&#39;t stop worrying about Tomo-chin~! Hang in there Tomo-chin, I&#39;m gonna use every last ounce of strength I possibly can to getcha oudda dere~!

Location: Ensemble Square - Hallway


Urrrrrgh♪ Raaaargh☆

Dammit! I thought Yumenosaki was bad, but ES is just as insane!
When I was looking on from a distance, I thought, &quot;Huh, looks like they&#39;re working pretty seriously lately, aren&#39;t they?&quot;
But this is what it actually looks like! Just because the wrapping paper&#39;s changed doesn&#39;t mean what&#39;s inside the box is any different, huh! These idols are just as unhinged as I remember them!
Every single one of you are sooo annoying~!

Ow ow ow, I told you not to yank on me like that! You&#39;re gonna rip my wrist off!

...If I rip To-mo-ya-kun&#39;s wrist off, I&#39;ll get the chance to escape on my own, huh?

Wait, don&#39;t say that, that&#39;s scary! You&#39;re joking, right!?

O-Of course I am. The announcement said something about zombies and stuff, but it&#39;s not as bad as an actual disaster film scenario.
The zombies chasing us are just the usual crew, and you can tell they&#39;re definitely not rotting or anything. We can&#39;t waste our time actually being scared of them, got it?

That&#39;s true... They keep saying &quot;urrrgh&quot; and try to bite us, though, so it&#39;s still a bit creepy. They can&#39;t even hold a conversation.
But even if they did manage to bite us, we wouldn&#39;t get infected.

Infected...?

In zombie movies, people who get bit by zombies get infected by a virus or something and turn into zombies themselves. That&#39;s how zombies multiply.

What th— That&#39;s so gross... That&#39;s a no from me, I&#39;m not interested in becoming an ugly rotting corpse, you hear? If I&#39;m gonna die, I want to die pretty!

Ahaha. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll actually escalate to become life-threatening, though. The zombies don&#39;t seem to listen to anything we say to them—
And we don&#39;t wanna get bitten, either, so let&#39;s just look out for incoming zombies, and look for the key at the same time.
That&#39;ll solve all our problems. After we escape, we can explain to everyone what happened, and go back to our ordinary lives.

......

...? What&#39;s wrong, Sena-senpai? Are you gonna say that I&#39;m &quot;mind-numbingly ordinary&quot; again?

Mn~... Actually, I was thinking that your ability to act so ordinarily in this ridiculously extreme situation is a talent on its own.
I&#39;ve been spending all this time running around like a headless chicken, but you somehow seem to be getting calmer and calmer. I just thought that was pretty impressive, that&#39;s all.

I&#39;m just used to the extraordinary. Rather, ever since I entered Yumenosaki, everything that happens around me has been ridiculous and strange.
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I&#39;d experience all of this!
So, somehow, I feel like today&#39;s just like any other day.

I see. But still, being able to stay sane as if it&#39;s &quot;just any other day,&quot; no matter how drastically your surroundings change—I think that&#39;s a pretty valuable skill. Someone like you could be really strong in this industry, y&#39;know?

Th-Thanks. But if I&#39;m not interesting enough just by being my ordinary self, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be very popular as an idol—
So I wanted some kind of redeeming feature or special talent that I could show off.
That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been practicing magic tricks so hard. I thought that could be what makes me unique, just like what the public and our agency are saying.
Well, that didn&#39;t work out as well as I&#39;d hoped, and I couldn&#39;t do anything better than just &quot;average,&quot; no matter how hard I tried.
And because of that, I messed up, and I even caused you all this trouble—

......

Oh, sorry. I started rambling again.

Like I said, I don&#39;t mind. It passes the time, anyway.
Besides, I think we&#39;re having a much more meaningful day than someone pretending to be a zombie and wandering all over the place for no good reason, aren&#39;t we?
So as thanks for spending some quality time with me, let me give you some advice as your senior.

Advice, and not criticism?

Not criticism. ...I think I&#39;ve had the same worries as you in the past, To-mo-ya-kun.

You, of all people, Sena-senpai?

Yeah.

You, who&#39;s always so confident it gets on people&#39;s nerves?

Why&#39;d you rephrase it like that? Do you want to make me angry?
Anyway, when I first entered Yumenosaki, my modeling career was starting to plateau...
My juniors were getting better and taking jobs that could&#39;ve been mine, and I didn&#39;t have my own place in the industry.
So I decided to use Yumenosaki as a new playing ground to develop my other talents.
But I turned out to not be that great at idol stuff. In the beginning, I could barely even handle the basics like singing and dancing.
When I stopped to look at the people around me, I found myself surrounded by more geniuses than I could count, all in a totally different league from me. I would compare myself to them, and I&#39;d feel completely discouraged.
Thinking back, that was pretty stupid. They&#39;re them, and I&#39;m me.
But look at me now. That pathetic loser managed to become so successful, he can act all high-and-mighty as a member of Knights, one of ES&#39;s Big Three. Can you guess why?

Huh? Isn&#39;t it because you found out you were talented after all?

I dunno about that... But, talented or not, there&#39;s always a road to success. In my case, I grabbed a nearby genius and used him as my weapon.
I used that weapon to strike down everyone else, and conquered the summit. But my weapon broke as a result of me using it so carelessly.
I probably made a big mistake there. But either way, I succeeded. I got the results and the praise I&#39;ve always wanted, and I regained my sense of self-worth.

......

You should just do the same, To-mo-ya-kun.
Though you shouldn&#39;t be reckless like me and hurt the people around you while doing so. Even if you&#39;re a normal, average person, you should still be able to succeed.
After all, we&#39;re not alone in our battles.
Thanks to the annoying-ass unit system being the mainstream, we&#39;ll have to group up with someone else whether we like it or not.
Leave the difficult stuff you can&#39;t do to someone else. It&#39;s nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of.
You don&#39;t have to do everything on your own.

......

If only the younger me could&#39;ve noticed that sooner.
If only I could&#39;ve thought of him as a teammate to fight along with side by side, instead of seeing him as a weapon that could only do whatever I told him to—
Maybe he wouldn&#39;t have had to suffer on his own and break under it all.
...Ah, sorry. You have no idea what I&#39;m going on about, huh. This is sooo embarrassing.

Nah. I&#39;ll use your words right back at you—I don&#39;t mind. Besides, it&#39;d be unfair if I made you listen to my worries and not let you do the same.
We&#39;re connected like this now, so I&#39;ll help you carry whatever you&#39;ve got on your shoulders.
I don&#39;t wanna become an extra piece of baggage for you, and it&#39;s easier for two people to carry it than just one, right?

Hmm? I don&#39;t really get what you&#39;re trying to say, but you&#39;re being pretty cheeky~♪

Didn&#39;t you say that &quot;a touch of rebelliousness is cute&quot;?
Besides. This rare piece of advice you gave me could come in handy.
You&#39;re right—we&#39;re not doing this alone, and we can leave the things we can&#39;t do to others who can.
Of course, it&#39;d be rude to make someone else always do all the work. That would break them, like you said. But yeah, I guess I can depend on others every once in a while.

......?

Sena-senpai, I&#39;ve just thought of a plan. Could you help me out?

Haa? I&#39;m not exactly in any position to not help you, am I?

That evening

We&#39;ve got you now, Izumi-chin! Now put &#39;em up! You&#39;re under arrest!

we went through a lot of trouble, didn&#39;t we~ it&#39;s already &quot;evening&quot;, and this story turned out to be as long as an &quot;epic&quot;.

Ugh, and thanks to him, we&#39;re becoming the hot topic on HoldHands and other social media.
They&#39;re saying stuff like &quot;The Creature Club guys are up to something stupid...&quot; And more and more spectators are coming to see what the fuss is all about.

fufu. they&#39;ve given us &quot;donations&quot; in the form of &quot;admission fees&quot; too. should we add them to the &quot;budget&quot; of the &quot;creature clubs&quot;?
if we do so, then we can &quot;solve&quot; our &quot;problems&quot; without having to fight or hurt each other over it♪

I guess that&#39;s a pretty idol-like way to do it~ Putting on a show and getting tips in a hat.[1]
It was only supposed to be a cover-up, but maybe we actually should stream Idol of the Dead and enable donations or something, huh?

let&#39;s think of that after we &quot;solve&quot; everything. all &quot;creatures&quot; that aren&#39;t &quot;human&quot; tend to not think so much about the &quot;future&quot;.
but even so, they live their lives to the &quot;fullest&quot;.

We&#39;re coming in! Give it up, Izumi-chin! We already know you&#39;re in this room~!

aah, that&#39;s cheating! you went first just when i was saying something &quot;deep&quot;!?

It&#39;s your fault for letting you guard down! We&#39;re still in the middle of a competition, y&#39;know~! We at Animals are gonna be the ones to catch Izumi-chin and get a bigger cut of the Creature Club budget!

not if i can help it~! Heroes never lose!

Location: Prop Room


Grrragh! Come out, Izumi-chin! You&#39;ll pay for the crime of putting your hands on my Tomo-chin with your life!

w-we won&#39;t kill him, right? we&#39;re only going to catch him, right?

Amazing! Greetings, my beloved compatriots of the Creature Clubs!
I am neither fin nor fur,[2] but as we are all creatures of the same world, I shall entertain each and every one of you amicably in our time here together!
Now, allow me to give a proper welcome! Would you like dinner? A bath? Or would you like...me?

......

wataru.
wait, what are you doing here? what kind of &quot;prank&quot; is this?

Hehehe. But—for the record—I too happen to be a member of ANIMALS, so it&#39;s not inconceivable for me to be here, wouldn&#39;t you agree?

Yeah, I guess, but... Huh? I swear I heard their voices coming from here—but they&#39;re nowhere to be seen? Wait, does that mean the voices I heard were from you, Wataru-chin?

Correct. I just happened to receive a humble request from Tomoya-kun as to whether I could use my mimicry abilities to impersonate them.
With that, I was able to buy them as much time as possible.

But why would you do that...?

Because he asked me to. As if I could ever say no to those adorable puppy-dog eyes he begged me with~♪
Besides, it&#39;s quite rare for Tomoya-kun to ask me for help, so I was over the moon...♪

Ack, so we came all the way here for nothing! We&#39;ve been tricked!
But if Tomo-chin was the one who asked Wataru-chin for the favor, does that mean he doesn&#39;t want to get caught either...?
Why? Could it be that Izumi-chin didn&#39;t actually abduct Tomo-chin against his will?

That&#39;s about right. And yet you jumped to conclusions and kicked up a massive fuss, creating a far bigger deal out of this than necessary...
I see you&#39;re just as easily flustered as ever, Mister Rabbit.

Huh~? But I&#39;m just so worried about Tomo-chin~!

I&#39;m sure you are. It&#39;s wonderful to hear that you&#39;re taking such excellent care of Tomoya-kun, who I entrusted to you.
Though, I wonder if you&#39;re too overprotective. Perhaps that&#39;s because I tend to favor a harsher training regime that packs a punch so hard it leaves a dent.
But one could say that it strikes a fine balance with your tendency to be a bit too soft on your juniors.

What are you talking about? More importantly, you seem to be on Tomo-chin&#39;s side, since you accepted his request—so where are they now?

Now? Well, you know what they say: a magician never reveals his secrets. So I&#39;m afraid I cannot tell you.

A magician...?

Correct. After all, Tomoya-kun does well when it counts. Or rather, he can do anything he sets his mind to.
He remained calm through this bizarre situation, came up with the best plan he could think of, and pulled off the most magnificent &quot;escape stunt.&quot;
Amazing! Pressure makes diamonds, after all!
Being mean to him and having my dove hide the key was worth it♪


	

Translation Notes
↑ In the original text, Nazuna calls the donations &quot;ohineri&quot; (おひねり). Ohineri refers to the tips actors receive in taishu engeki (大衆演劇, lit. &quot;theater for the masses,&quot; a genre of Japanese theater), and its name is based on how these tips were originally presented to the actors by wrapping money in a piece of paper, twisting it into a knot, and tossing it on stage during the show. Nowadays, ohineri is usually given by clipping bills or envelopes of money to the actors' clothes, or by handing it to them directly after the show.↑ Literally &quot;neither of the land nor the sea&quot; (陸のものとも海のものともつかない).

Season: Winter
Location: SS Stage?


In a dream, or perhaps a vision?

&quot;♪ ~ ♪ ~ ♪&quot;
(Oh—)
(This is another dream, huh.)

&quot;Let&#39;s all give our blessings! The winners of this year&#39;s SS, the idol industry&#39;s biggest event, are—&quot;
&quot;Ra*bits, the unit everyone loves! Cute is justice! Cute is invincible!&quot;

&quot;......♪&quot;
(Ahaha, so we won SS? There&#39;s no way that could&#39;ve happened, even if the world turned upside down.)
(Or rather, why is Nii~chan acting like he did nothing? He seems to be the announcer now? I know this is a dream, but even this feels weird.)

&quot;Congrats! I knew you guys could do it! I was sure everything would work out even without my help!&quot;

(&quot;Even without me&quot;...? What? But Nii~chan&#39;s already been back for a while now...)
(He thought long and hard about what path he wanted to go down so he could live an honest life.)
(He came back after taking a break from college and putting up with everything.)

&quot;Really, congrats! You guys are my pride and joy~♪&quot;

(...Nii~chan.)
(Why are you always acting like you did nothing to contribute? The reason why we&#39;re all here in the first place is because of you, Nii~chan.)
(If it was just us, then we&#39;d all just trip while we were taking our first steps and wouldn&#39;t be able to keep going forward. We&#39;d just get lost and have no idea where to go.)
(Everything that happened so far was thanks to you, Nii~chan.)

&quot;I love y&#39;all! My precious, beloved Ra*bits!&quot;

(I love you too. We all love you too.)

&quot;......♪&quot;

(......? Huh? Did he just walk right past me?)
(Can&#39;t you see me, Nii~chan?)
Nii~chan!


.........
...You.
Why are you here.

Huh? What?

...This is all because of you.

Location: Downtown Alley


Reality. Early December, SS mid-qualifying rounds. Kanto.

......!
Pant, pant...
(T-Thank god! It was just a dream! I knew it was just a dream!)
(I have no idea what it meant! Nii~chan was pretty distant to me—)
(I&#39;ve heard that dreams usually have some sort of deep meaning to them, but what kind of fears and desires was that one trying to tell me about?)
Urgh, stop it! Forget about it! A dream is just a dream—it has nothing to do with real life!
Wait, huh?! Where the hell am I?
Dammit! This is all the Masked Perv&#39;s fault, huh?! He&#39;s gonna pop up any second now!
I am not gonna forgive you this time! It&#39;s about time you realize that using people as toys is a crime!
(...I need to calm down! That would&#39;ve been true if this was last year, but Hibiki-senpai&#39;s become a much better person now!)
(He&#39;s too busy to pay attention to me anyways, right? So I think he&#39;s not the culprit! Probably!)
(I went to bed like normal, but then I woke up in some shady alley! This type of cryptic situation is kinda like something Hibiki-senpai would do, though!)
(Jeez, what the hell is happening? This is way too weird! Just yesterday, all the other ES idols and I were sleeping at the inn!)
(A lot of the idols here in Kanto were pretty demotivated, but we&#39;ll at least do our very best!)
(Even if we don&#39;t make it to the next round, we&#39;ll put in all of our effort to entertain and heal the people who came to see us!)
(That&#39;s the promise we all made last night, and we slept together side by side.)
(But how did I end up here? Am I dreaming again...?)
(I heard that things were pretty messed up in other places, but...)
(We&#39;re in Kanto, the kind of place where everything is normal. Peaceful, even.)
.........
(I really need to calm down! I shouldn&#39;t start panicking or thinking about nonsense like this! I need to clear my mind and chill out.)
(First, I should, um, call for help— Wait, my phone&#39;s gone?! And I fell asleep while I was wearing my yukata... Since when did I change clothes?!)
(Ugh... What the hell is going on... This would be weird even for some hidden camera TV show. Augh, I heard that you still have to get prior consent from the actors in those shows to do something like this!)
(...Oh, I know. This is that &quot;old-fashioned idol common sense&quot; thing. But I don&#39;t know how much of that can be applied to modern times.)
...Hm?
(What&#39;s that? There&#39;s something shimmering on the other side!)
(Is it the moonlight? It&#39;s an amazingly beautiful silver color—)


.........

Of course it was the Masked Pervert! I&#39;m an idiot for thinking that your hair was some mystical object!
Oooh, what did you do this time? Is this a prank or something?
It&#39;s pretty much guaranteed that fine is gonna pass the qualifying rounds, so I bet you and the others have tons of free time right now.
But isn&#39;t playing around with me just a waste of time—

.........

Um, heeeello? Can you at least answer back...? You better not jump back up to surprise me.
I&#39;m not dumb enough to fall for your tricks again, y&#39;know?

.........

...Hey. You can really stop playing around now.

.........

.........
...No way.
Don&#39;t tell me that you&#39;re actually...d-dead...?

Series: Uma Musume
Characters: Agnes Tachyon, Manhattan Cafe, Sakura Bakushin O
TLC: 310mc

	





	
		My head hurts...
	

(Huh... Where the hell am I...?)


	
		I slowly awaken from the dark state that surrounded me when—
	

Location: Nurse's Office


......Oh, have you woken up?

A-Agnes Tachyon...?

You appear to be a bit confused. You did just regain consciousness, so you better not exert yourself.
Go sit in this chair. Make yourself feel at home.


	
		I sat down in the chair just as she said.
	

Now then... You&#39;re probably wondering how you ended up in this situation. Remember anything?
By the way, I was the one who brought you over here. Therefore, what you need to remember is &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; you blacked out.

Umm...


	
		I somehow managed to wrap my throbbing head around this. If I recall correctly, I was walking down the hallway when...
	

Location: Hallway

Hoooold it! Tachyon-san, wait right hereeeee!


Oh my. Whatever is the matter, Bakushin O-kun? It&#39;s not like your beloved classroom was burned to a crisp.

Right! It wasn&#39;t burned to a crisp!

So all is well. I shall take my leave.

The class prez commands you to stooooop! There is nothing &quot;well&quot; about this at all!
 It may not be burned to a crisp, but it was very much close to being that!

There was just a little smoke in the corner, right? Would a class president really be this worked up about that?

Huh?! Um, hmm... Now that you mention it...
Would a benevolent class president forgive something so trivial like filling an entire classroom with smoke...?

Leniency is a virtue, Class President. If that&#39;s all, I&#39;ll truly be leaving now—

...Wait, no! Thinking of it, the teacher said &quot;bring her to me no matter what she says&quot; eight times!
And because of that, I&#39;m not letting you go so easily, Tachyon-saaaan!

Ahahaha! You truly won&#39;t get fooled, huh?

I&#39;m not going to let you get awayyyy! Bakushin bakushiiiin!
Ah! Trainer over there! Don&#39;t let Tachyon-san get awayyyy!

M-Me...?

Hm...? Oop!


	
		......
	

Location: Nurse's Office


......Hmm, it seems you have recovered some of your memories.


	
		After regaining memory, I realize that the girl in front of me is the one responsible for filling a whole classroom with smoke...
	

Why did you fill a whole classroom up with smoke...?

What a strange question to ask. There&#39;s no other answer to this than &quot;it&#39;s part of my research&quot;!


	
		When Agnes Tachyon said "research," a mysterious sparkle appeared in her eyes.
	

I have a bad feeling about this...


	
		It's best to not get involved with her. I was about to stand up when I realized—
	
	
		(Creak...)
	

Huh?! I can't move?!


	
		I got tied to the chair without noticing...!
	

Are you the type of person to get so lost in thought that you forget your surroundings? I&#39;m also the same, so I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t know how that feels.
Nevertheless, I shall kindly advise you to keep an eye on your surroundings at all times.
After all, you&#39;ll never know when you run into a researcher that&#39;s looking for a healthy, adult test subject.

T-Test subject...?!

As for me, I&#39;d say it&#39;s good luck that you came around. Maybe I should thank God every once in a while.
Everyone in the school knows about me at this point. I can barely ask anyone to be my test subject before they run away from me.
Despite all of that— Hahaha! A total newcomer who has never heard of the rumors about me manifested right in front of my eyes! What are the chances?!
And so, little guinea pig—I mean, Rookie Trainer.

Did you just call me a guinea pig?!

A grown man should not worry about such trivial matters!
That aside, I&#39;ll be giving you a— Actually, since you&#39;re big and strong, I&#39;ll be giving you three pills to take.

What are these pills for...?

Ghehehe. Well, that is for you to find out.
Don&#39;t worry about it... The worst that could happen is that both of your legs would start glowing green for while. Isn&#39;t that a cute side effect?
What&#39;s more important is being able to observe the effects of the human quadriceps contracting caused by this drug
It is a well known fact that horse girls and humans have almost identical body structures. However, by comparing symptoms from both species, it&#39;s possible to develop a new—

Tachyon-san... What are you doing this time...?

Oh hello, Cafe! What&#39;s the matter? Are you going to help me with my experi—

I am not. I&#39;m only here because the teacher&#39;s calling you. It seems they want to discuss your participation in the next race...
They&#39;re waiting. Hurry up and go... Right now...

Alright, alright. I get it. No need to make that scary face at me! Looks like we&#39;re out of time. I&#39;ll be conducting the tests at a later date.
Until we meet again, Rookie Trainer!

...Sigh. I&#39;ll untie you.


	
		I am—from the bottom of my heart—so grateful that I've been "saved."

Series: Ensemble Stars!!
Gacha: Feature Scout: Tsumugi Edition
Writer: Yuumasu
Characters: Koga Ogami, Nazuna Nito, Subaru Akehoshi, Tomoya Mashiro, Wataru Hibiki

Season: Summer
Location: Seisou Hall Courtyard


Daikichi, Leon, lookie here~☆
Ta-da! It&#39;s a frisbee! Whoever gets it first wins the game! ☆
Allllright☆ Ready and... Fetch!

Don&#39;t you lose, Leon. You&#39;ve gotta show everyone that you&#39;re better than these chumps!

Do your best, Daikichi. If you get first place, you&#39;ll get this gourmet beef jerky♪

Heeey, I brought some stuff we can use to set up the obstacle course!

Thanks, Nii~chan! We could use the chairs and clothes line to make a hurdle.

Woah, you brought some nets too. They&#39;re a must for obstacle races, but why the hell were these even in the dorms?

I brought these from Yumenosaki. I asked the tennis team&#39;s advisor if I could borrow some, but he ended up just giving me all of these old nets.
He was about to throw them all away, so he was glad I could take them off his hands.
...Oh, look at Leon. He&#39;s jumping around with a frisbee in his mouth~

That&#39;s my partner for ya. He didn&#39;t even break a sweat.

You worked really hard, didn&#39;t you, Daikichi? There, there. You&#39;re deeefinitely gonna win next time...☆

Both Leon and Daikichi seem quite happy. Animals really do heal your soul...

You&#39;re the only one in ANIMALS that doesn&#39;t have a pet, Tomo-chin. Don&#39;t you want one?

Yeah. You&#39;re allowed to keep pets here, so I guess it&#39;d be fine to have one...♪
But I never had a pet before. Do you guys have any recommendations for a beginner?

A dog, obviously. I get if ya dunno what breed to get, though.

Yup! Dogs are great~ They&#39;re obedient; and they&#39;ll keep you in great shape too &#39;cause you&#39;ll need to walk &#39;em every day☆

Rabbits are just as great! They&#39;re easy to take care of—and more importantly, they&#39;re super cute! ♪
If you&#39;re a beginner, maybe a pet you can keep indoors—like a hamster—would be good. I heard hedgehogs are easy to take care of too.

Huh, you can keep hedgehogs as pets?
I guess those are good too... But like, I&#39;m a bit overwhelmed with all the choices.

Point is, you&#39;ve gotta take responsibility of &#39;em &#39;til the end, got that? Pets aren&#39;t just any other animals. They&#39;re your partners, your family.

Ah, right. Humans have longer life spans than most animals, huh...
I remember now. I never wanted to have a pet because it&#39;d be so hard to say goodbye to them.
The more we spend time together, the more painful it&#39;d be to part with them...

Ah, but aren&#39;t you aware that you&#39;ll miss out on so many important encounters if you fear parting too much?

Whoa! Was that Hibiki-senpai?

Yeah. Who else would that be, anyway?

Huh? There&#39;s something moving in your shirt, Tomoya-kun.

Eh— Eeek!? When did a dove get in here?

My dove isn&#39;t the only one here; I&#39;ve come along as well.
Greetings from behind your back! &#39;Tis I, your Wataru Hibiki...☆
I&#39;m practically green with envy, seeing all the members of ANIMALS enjoy themselves without me! How lonely it is to be left out! Sniff, sniff.

The hell are ya sayin&#39;? You&#39;re the one who told us you couldn&#39;t come &#39;cause of work.

Hehehe, that&#39;s correct...☆ However, I managed to finish earlier than expected, so I came to join you all.
By the way, Tomoya-kun. Do you have any recollection of that dove you&#39;re holding?

&quot;Recollection&quot;... Ah, is this Jeanne d&#39;Arc?[1]

That&#39;s absolutely correct; this is the child you saved. She hasn&#39;t been bullied by those around her at all lately, and now—as you can see—she&#39;s doing perfectly well.

&quot;Saved&quot;? You&#39;re exaggerating. You were the one who actually took care of her.

However, if you hadn&#39;t brought her to me, I wouldn&#39;t have even known she was in such a state. And she surely wouldn&#39;t have emerged unscathed either.
So you truly did save her, Tomoya-kun.

H-Huh... Thanks.

You were speaking of life spans just now, correct?
As I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, although there are exceptions, animals tend to have shorter life spans than humans.
But that is precisely why we live with them and watch over them.
We need to create an abundance of memories with them so that we never forget the fact that they lived here, by our sides. That is the duty of us creatures who live longer, I believe.
In any case, I cannot recommend that you take a pet under your wing on a mere whim. Until you come to a proper decision, it would be best for you to satisfy yourself with ANIMALS&#39; activities.

Yup, yup! Lemme know anytime you wanna go on a walk with Daikichi☆

Leon&#39;s a lone wolf, but he&#39;ll let you pet him—don&#39;t make a habit of it, though.

And come to my room whenever you feel like spending time with rabbits. I&#39;ll make sure you enjoy their fluffiness~♪

Haha... Thank you, everyone!

Speaking of walks... Dogs naturally need them, but were you aware that you can take doves on walks too?

How d&#39;you take doves on walks, though? Do you just put &#39;em on your shoulders?

Not at all. I take them on walks through the sky in my hot air balloon, you see.
On that note, Tomoya-kun, let us do exactly that...☆

Woaaah! Don&#39;t jump onto the balloon while carrying meee! P-Put me down~!

Season: Spring
Location: Dance Studio


&quot;Come now, everyone! Take a look and laugh!&quot;
&quot;I am a clown who seeks to spread laughter through silly antics!&quot;
&quot;Feel free to spit and throw rocks at me to cast away your daily sorrows! ♪&quot;
(Ugh... That came out differently than I&#39;d expected
(What am I doing wrong? I can&#39;t get into my role!)
(They told me that it would be a bit more challenging this time, but I should&#39;ve learned some techniques from last year...)
(I stumble the moment I step out of my comfort zone. What am I supposed to do? I wish I was better at applying my skills into new roles—)
Eek!
Ah, you scared me! D-Do you need something, Producer? Man, with all that clapping out of nowhere, I thought you were a ghost!
You sure have a quiet presence... Oh, hold on. Is my time in the dance studio up?
So you&#39;re here to tell me to leave?
I&#39;m sorry! I was actually practicing with everyone else in Ra*bits, but Hajime and Mitsuru had to do work of their own. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here alone.
There was some time left in the booking, so I thought I might as well do some rehearsal by myself!
I couldn&#39;t practice my part for Ra*bits since I wanted the others to keep pace.
Shoot, I was so caught up in rehearsing that I lost track of time! I&#39;ll pack up and leave right away—
Woah?!
Ahaha. Guess I tripped...♪
You were laughing just now huh, Producer? Oh no, I&#39;m not saying that was rude.
That laugh! That&#39;s the exact reaction I wanted out of my audience! Um, could you tell me what was so funny about what I just did?
Oh, I&#39;m being too pushy? Sorry, I was in a rush...
You see, I&#39;m starting to get some real acting jobs. The role I got cast for this time is a bit challenging...
Sigh, this all started because I&#39;ve been in the Drama Club for quite a while. During one of the performances I was in, someone took notice and scouted me.
That gave me an opportunity to be in movies and theatricals, though they were all supporting roles.
It&#39;s quite rare for someone to act well despite looking like a child nowadays.
I&#39;ve been taking advantage of this feature of mine here and there.
When people think of child actors, they think of me, Tomoya Mashiro! ...That&#39;s the kind of reputation I have at this point, more or less.
But I&#39;m already a second year! I&#39;m not sure how to feel about being considered a &quot;child actor&quot;...
Well, I&#39;m happy to get the roles either way. I do love acting, after all.
Plus, Ra*bits is struggling a bit right now with how we have to do solo gigs on the side to get by.
It&#39;s the same for Nii~chan, who&#39;s already gone off to college. Each of us has to improve our own skills to gain individual popularity.
By doing so, we can draw attention to the unit.
That&#39;s why I want to make a name for myself as an actor.
However, I want to be noticed as an idol and for Ra*bits.
Our agency, Rhythm Link, is well-known and has a long history. It&#39;s pretty hard to stand out.
These guys tend to prioritize seniority over merit, so the people who&#39;ve been here for a long time take all the high-profile jobs.
We rarely get any worthwhile opportunities.
Oh, don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m not criticizing the agency.
That&#39;s one reason why we chose to be in Rhythm Link. Their status and long history can be beneficial to us!
Anyways... Umm, what was I talking about again? I always lose myself when I get too excited.
Where was I? Well, I was given the chance to perform with a fairly renowned theater company.
I was cast as a little clown or, to be more precise, a mischievous fairy.
Yep, it&#39;s similar to Puck from A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream. I play a trickster who skips across the stage and causes trouble.
The role reminded me of two guys I look up to, so I was really motivated!
Yet I wasn&#39;t able to pull it off... Back at my school&#39;s Drama Club, I only played as princes and princesses. I&#39;d over-exaggerate my parts no matter what I do.
I don&#39;t have to ask anyone to tell nobody&#39;s going to find my performance entertaining as is.
I was too stiff, let alone playful. So the feeling of a mischievous fairy didn&#39;t come across at all.
Huh? I should mimic Ra*bits&#39; behavior instead?
Sure, I guess we get treated like fairies sometimes.
But our behavior typically resembles what good kids do. My role requires pulling pranks and having a sharp tongue, so I don&#39;t think that fits...
If I emphasize Ra*bits too much, I would tarnish our pure and innocent image.
Maybe people will grow tired of us if we just stick to being good kids.
However, that&#39;s only the brand we made for Ra*bits.
I want to keep that image. I know I&#39;m trying to eat my cake and have it too...
But a true actor—a true idol—makes the impossible possible and turns dreams into reality. That is who I, Tomoya Mashiro, aspire to be.

Comments
The lines Tomoya acted out in the first three lines seem to reference what Wataru said in Transparency and Masks...?

Come, curse me. Throw stones at this lying coward... Please, spit at and kick this horrible imposter who plays with people's hearts.

Season: Summer
Location: Drama Clubroom


President, do you have a moment? There&#39;s something I&#39;d like to discuss with you.

Oh? How rare of you to have business with me, Hokuto-kun!
But I could definitely spare a moment, as this Wataru Hibiki will grant all that you desire! Ahahahaha☆

Why are you hyped up all of a sudden? Calm down. Don&#39;t get so close to me, it&#39;s suffocating.

Summer is upon us~! If you don&#39;t remember how to sweat correctly, your brain will start to boil due to unregulated body temperature!

You worry too much. Unlike you, I can&#39;t control my sweat. If it gets hot, I&#39;ll automatically start sweating.

You mustn&#39;t give up without trying! With training, you, too, can control your sweat! This is negligence, Hokuto-kun. You must aim beyond the stars!

I don&#39;t need you telling me that. For one, I&#39;m not trying to be a human jack-in-a-box.

Who are you calling a &quot;human jack-in-the-box&quot;...? What a perfectly fitting name! Amazing☆
Hehehe. Now then, what would you like to discuss with me?

Right... President, give him a break already.

Do you know how little that narrows it down? I could think of a vast amount of people when you say that, so you have to be more specific.

 It&#39;s about Tomoya. You&#39;ve been sending your doves to monitor him, correct? They&#39;ve been bothering him day and night.
Apparently, they also show up whenever he uses the restroom and takes baths. He can&#39;t relax because it&#39;s like you&#39;re always watching him—even in private.
 It&#39;s an invasion of privacy. Tomoya&#39;s close to breaking down... For this reason, I would like you to tell your doves to stop monitoring him.

Hmm? It is true that I had a small camera attached to my dove to keep an eye on him.
However, I was getting too bored, so I put an end to that a long time ago.
As an actor, you must always be aware that you&#39;re being watched... It&#39;s a game for him to understand the most basic of basics.
It wasn&#39;t to peek into his daily life.

Is that so? How odd, that doesn&#39;t line up with what I&#39;ve been told. Tomoya says that there&#39;s still a dove following him.

Are you sure it&#39;s not him being paranoid? Tomoya-kun must really have some mental issues...
I shall reflect on my actions. It truly troubles me that I have no idea how far is too far.

That&#39;s right. You better reconsider what you&#39;ve done.
But that sure is strange... Tomoya went through a lot to show me a video of a bird you were going to train for a magic trick.
It&#39;s a special breed of dove you don&#39;t find around here.

Hmm... Whatever could it be?
How mysterious! Aah, there are still so many amazing things hidden in this world...☆

P-P-P-Pre-Preeeez...!

...Speak of the devil. You startled me. What&#39;s wrong, Tomoya?

Oh, good afternoon, Hokuto-senpai! You&#39;re as cool today as ever...☆

Hm? Thanks?

Tomoya-kun, Tomoya-kun. Is that my dove you have there? It looks absolutely exhausted... What happened?

That&#39;s what I&#39;m here to ask!
I didn&#39;t hear any wing flapping today, so I finally thought that I wasn&#39;t being chased anymore... Like I could finally have some peace of mind, y&#39;know?
But something felt off, so I looked around... And there it was, passed out on the side of the road.
It would be really bad if it got ran over by a bicycle and such, so I picked it up right away.
B-But what the hell am I supposed to do now?! This is your bird, so do something about it...!

Hehehe. It&#39;s wonderful that you can still be kind to the dove who has been chasing you around and causing you anxiety, Tomoya-kun.
Let me have a look. Ah, this is certainly one of my doves... She&#39;s been missing for quite some time now. Her name is Jeanne d&#39;Arc.

Why does she have such a grandiose name?

I named her such because she loves to perch on crosses... Oh dear, there&#39;s a fresh wound across her body. Did a stray cat attack you?

C-Can you help her? I could go grab the first-aid kit from the nurse&#39;s office!

Ah, there&#39;s no need to do that. I have one right here.
My doves often get scratches whenever we do a play, so I have a first-aid kit on hand at all times♪
Please hold still, Jeanne d&#39;Arc... This will only take a moment~♪
...Mhm, you should be alright now. It&#39;s fortunate that this isn&#39;t a grave injury, so her life isn&#39;t in any danger.

I-Is that so? What a relief...♪

Yes. However, I&#39;ve been worried for her health, since she hasn&#39;t been eating well. I&#39;ll make a bed for her to rest in.

Oh, I can look after her!
It&#39;s kinda weird—I guess I got attached to her since she&#39;s always with me... I was super worried when I saw her on the ground!
It really is weird, huh? That I feel like this towards a dove that&#39;s been stalking me around!

Not at all. It&#39;s human nature to feel close to things that you&#39;ve been around with for an extended period of time.
Since I&#39;m always right here for you, isn&#39;t it quite like how you two are gradually coming to love me?

No. To be honest, the more I stick around you, the more it feels like I don&#39;t know you at all. Kinda makes me wanna move far away from you.

I know exactly how you feel, Tomoya.

My underclassmen are so cruel... You made your president sad. Sob, sob.
Anyhow, I&#39;ll be taking my dear Jeanne d&#39;Arc home to take care of her. It&#39;s likely that I have to train her all over again.

Huh, you can&#39;t leave her in the clubroom?

I could, yes. Eichi would likely give me permission to keep an animal here if I were to ask him.
However, Jeanne d&#39;Arc also has scratches from her fellow doves, not just stray cats.
She&#39;s been getting bullied by those who are supposed to be her friends.
It&#39;s a good thing you saved her quickly.
But she might not be as lucky next time, so I need to isolate her in a safe place.

Huh, bullied...? That&#39;s awful. She didn&#39;t do anything wrong.

Hehehe. It&#39;s common for birds to start pecking those who are weak and don&#39;t fit in.
She&#39;s a bit like Cinderella, wouldn&#39;t you say?
And in the fairytale, Cinderella gets rescued by a prince.
But in real life, one can still face persecution even if they were saved by a prince.
People will get envious and say it&#39;s unfair—that it&#39;s favoritism...
Please keep that in mind, Tomoya-kun.
Animals love you, no? For that reason, someone who adores you could fall into misery by the weight of your fans&#39; &quot;jealousy.&quot;
Let this be a lesson to you, to avoid repeating the same tragedy.
Until you grow to become a prince that can rescue all the Cinderellas in the world.

Translation Notes
Title Breakdown
Jeanne d'Arc was a French soldier that received visions from saints to recover France from England. The royal court was drawn to her possibly due to viewing her as a beacon of hope. She appeared to them during a time the French was defeated numerous of times and were desperate. She led a number of successful military campaigns and boosted French morale. On May 23, 1430, d'Arc was captured by the Burgundian faction and put on trial. After being declared guilty by Pierre Cauchon, she was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431. She was around nineteen years old. d'Arc was canonized as a saint on May 16, 1920.
Based on Charles Perrault's version, Cinderella, a girl with immense kindness, lived in terrible conditions under her stepmother and stepsisters. Her stepsisters received an invitation to the prince's ball and once they depart for it, a fairy godmother came down to Cinderella and transformed her into a fine lady. The whole court, especially the prince, was entranced by her. Having a curfew at midnight, she had to suddenly depart and left behind a glass slipper. The prince vowed to marry the girl that owed it and had all the women in the kingdom try it on. In the end, Cinderella and the prince got married, and her stepsisters got married to other noblemen.
Jeanne d'Arc was a peasant and Cinderella was treated as a servant. However, Cinderella had a happily ever after, while d'Arc died at the stake.
Analysis
Jeanne d'Arc (Cinderella) is a parallel of Wataru (particularly from his childhood). The &quot;prince&quot; that saved him were his inherent talents. However, as a result of his immense talent, people moved away from him. The &quot;tragedy&quot; Wataru speaks of is what happened to himself, and tells Tomoya to not end up like him. This is also noted in Phantom Thieves VS Detectives, as he warns Tomoya that becoming &quot;extraordinary&quot; can cause him to be disconnected from others—he doesn't want Tomoya to become one of &quot;those who don't fit in.&quot;
Additionally, the real Jeanne d'Arc was burned at the stake by her own people: the Burgundian party were supporters of the Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless, a scion of the French royal family. She also lived in an isolated patch that was surrounded by pro-Burgundian lands. In Elements, Wataru was executed by his fellow idols.
Tl;dr: Jeanne d'Arc = Cinderella = Wataru.
The Cinderella of Ensemble Stars was Wataru all along, not Tomoya (despite him getting the role). It's kinda like a subtle way of Wataru asking Tomoya to become a prince that can save him (which he ends up becoming in Transparency and Masks)—the prince that will follow him to the end of the world and beyond.
Notes

渉: ファンの『やっかみ』によって、あなたを慕う誰かが不幸になることもあるんです
Wataru: For that reason, someone who adores you could fall into misery by the weight of your fans' &quot;jealousy.&quot;

That &quot;someone&quot; most likely refers to Wataru himself.

                                卯の花 (unohana) is a pseudonym for Deutzia crenata, a white flowering shrub native to (and common in) Japan. The "卯" in the name refers to the fourth Chinese zodiac, the rabbit, due to the flowers blooming in April. Its other name, ウツギ/空木 (utsugi), comes from its hollow stems. 空木 means "empty shrub" literally.
                            
                            
                                卯の花色 (unohana-iro) is yellow-tinted white color ★ (#FBFBF6). Kotobank and the Color Dictionary lists it as a blue-tinted white color ★ (#F7FCFE).
                            
                            
                                Tomoya's last name, Mashiro (真白), means pure white or blank. This will play a role in the second chapter.

...Once we blind the audience here, the lights go to blackout. Then we&#39;ll change the props and the next scene begins.

Yeah. I&#39;ve been able to practice as both roles until now, but it&#39;ll be hard to do so in all the scenes after.

Let&#39;s stop here for now. I know it&#39;s earlier than usual, but can we call it a day?

Let&#39;s. We do still have some time remaining with this room, however, so I&#39;m leaving you all to your own devices until it runs out.
I&#39;m going to hear what our composer&#39;s done for the finishing touches on Dramatica&#39;s musical numbers.

That means you&#39;ll be on a video call with Leo-kun, right? In that case, I&#39;m going too.
See you later, Hokuto-chan, Tomoya-chan. Break a leg, you two! ♪

Alright. Good work today, Narukami.

Thanks for all the hard work! I&#39;ll do my best too!
(I could practice on my own, but I already memorized all of my lines... I guess I&#39;ll just focus on this thing for now.)
(My personalized outfit... I was overjoyed when Anzu-san said it was my turn to get one but...)
(The moment she asked what kind of outfit I&#39;d like, my mind went blank—I totally panicked. It was so embarrassing.)
(She told me to tell her if I had any ideas, but I can&#39;t even think of a single one that&#39;s good...)
(How did everyone else come up with their personalized outfits? Should I go check on HoldHands?)
(...Narukami-senpai looks quite refined. She doesn&#39;t have a lot of accessories on, but that&#39;s exactly what makes her own beauty stand out.)
(Kanzaki-senpai&#39;s costume has his family crest on it. Doesn&#39;t get any better than that, huh? It suits him—he looks really cool.)
(It&#39;s amazing to see how everyone&#39;s characters were brought out.)
(&quot;Characters,&quot; huh... A personalized outfit is supposed to represent one&#39;s character, but there&#39;s nothing special about me.)
(...Oh, it&#39;s a picture of Mitsuru. When he came to show me his, he said something like, &quot;I was thinkin&#39; about what made me wanna become an idol!&quot;)
(Maybe I can draw some inspiration from that?)
(The reason why I want to become an idol was because &quot;the idols I saw on TV looked amazing.&quot;)
(But there&#39;s absolutely nothing special about that! It&#39;s so basic! Looks that idea&#39;s thrown out the window... Ugh.)

Tomoya, what&#39;s wrong? Is there something on your mind?

Ah, Hokuto-senpai.

Your acting just now was on point, so I don&#39;t believe you have any need to worry about that... However, if you feel you need more practice, I can stay behind with you.

Ahaha. Thank you. To be honest, I was actually worrying about something, but it&#39;s not related to acting...
It&#39;s about my personalized outfit. I can&#39;t come up with any ideas no matter what I do.
How were you able to come up with yours, Hokuto-senpai?

How did I? Mm, I had a person in mind as my target. That&#39;s all.

A &quot;target,&quot; huh...
(My goal is to become a dazzling, magnificent idol. They are pretty much like, admiration personified. But...)
(Exactly what do people in this world admire?)

Location: Costume Room


Sorry for making you come with me.

I don&#39;t mind; my adorable junior asked me to, after all. Anyway, shouldn&#39;t you keep trying clothes on?

Ah, right. I&#39;ll try this outfit on next!
(I think people admire protagonists in plays and movies.)
(So I&#39;m trying out some stage clothes to see if any good ideas pop up. However...)
The next costume I&#39;ll try on is from One Thousand and One Nights!

Mm. It&#39;s just as cute as the Mermaid Prince outfit you tried on before.

Thank you. That&#39;s the fifth time in a row you said I was &quot;cute.&quot; I was hoping that you&#39;d say something other than that.

Ah, sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to say so each time, it&#39;s just how I feel.

No need to apologize! I&#39;m just bad at being anything that isn&#39;t &quot;cute,&quot; so it&#39;s all on me!
Every word that comes out of your mouth should be written down, framed, and displayed in a museum!
So! I&#39;m gonna try and find an outfit that&#39;ll make you say something other than &quot;cute&quot;!
Not this one... And not this one either...
Aha, this is it! I&#39;ll try on The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes next!

Hold on, Tomoya. You&#39;ll be basically wearing nothing at all with that, so it&#39;s not much help as a reference, is it?

You&#39;ll never know unless you try. You might even be surprised at how well it fits.
Besides, everyone else&#39;s personalized outfit made them stand out. I wanna stand out just as much as them! If I don&#39;t do this, I&#39;ll—

Ohh, how splendid!

Woah!? A dove just came out of that sleeve... And it&#39;s talking!

Pull yourself together, Tomoya. No matter how you look at it, this is just one of that guy&#39;s tricks.

&quot;That guy&#39;s&quot;... Ah.

Hehehe. So the both of you are thinking of me?
Well, you&#39;re correct! The one who spoke just now was not this dove, but rather I! Your very own Wataru Hibiki...☆
Tomoya-kun. Have you finally come up with an idea for your personalized outfit after trying on costume after costume?
King Lear, Macbeth, Romeo, Sherlock Holmes, Qin Shi Huang, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Ryoma Sakamoto, Napoleon Bonaparte...
What do you want to be? Who do you want to be?

Huh. &quot;Who&quot;...?
(With how I kept trying clothes on, it&#39;s not surprising I feel this way. But...)
(I kept trying to become someone else... Is this truly &quot;Tomoya Mashiro&quot;?)

(...Looks like I misunderstood something.)
(It&#39;s fun acting as other people on stage. Like, it&#39;s as if you&#39;ve become a whole different person.)
(But that is only the actor &quot;Tomoya Mashiro,&quot; not the idol &quot;Tomoya Mashiro.&quot;)
(As an idol on stage, I have to fight as the person I truly am.)

Oh? There&#39;s truly no need for you to look so despondent.
Everything you wear will suit you, and as such you&#39;ll be able to play any role you&#39;d like. Just like your name, you are a canvas of pure white[1]. You can be painted in any color; you can become anything your heart desires.
Perhaps I can only view this so positively because it is precisely what I am lacking, but...
Your &quot;problem&quot; is actually a skill that those with strong personalities cannot obtain no matter how desperately they may wish to.

That&#39;s right, Tomoya. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re cute without any thought, I really do think so.
You can become whoever and whatever you&#39;d like. With that in mind, why don&#39;t you think again about what you&#39;d like to be?

Thank you, Hibiki-senpai, Hokuto-senpai...
I&#39;m going to rethink on how to design my personalized outfit from scratch.

Location: Seisou Hall Common Room


(I&#39;m watching some idol concerts as reference.)
(...Idols really are amazing, huh. They&#39;re always shining and full of joy.)
(The venue is completely packed. I used to be right there, just another member of the audience, before I became an idol.)

Tomoya-kun, would you like to drink some warm milk with me?

Oh, Hajime... Yeah, sure. Thanks.

Don&#39;t mention it. Is it alright if I sit next to you? I&#39;d like to watch the concert too.

Of course. We&#39;re friends, after all. You don&#39;t have to ask for permission every time.

Ehehehe, alright then. I&#39;ll plop right down♪
...Tomoya-kun, are you worried about your personalized outfit by chance?

Uh... What makes you think that?

We&#39;re friends, aren&#39;t we? I felt like that might be the case.

Haha, yep. You saw right through me... It&#39;s just as you say: I&#39;m worrying about my personalized outfit—to the point where I&#39;m starting to panic a bit.


Mitsuru was able to come up with a design that suits him, so why can&#39;t I do the same?
I don&#39;t really know what my idol self is like at all...
I was trying to do what Mitsuru did: use the reason why I became an idol as a reference. However, my reason for becoming an idol is so boring... &quot;The idols I saw on TV looked amazing! Maybe I could become one too,&quot; and such...

Mm-mm, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a boring reason at all... Do you remember what I told you a long, looong time ago?
I said that I wasn&#39;t really interested in idols. That I loved you and didn&#39;t want be separated from you, so I just tagged along without a single thought.
Tomoya-kun, you were the one who always stood by my side, no matter how painful and miserable it got.
You befriended me, and even the reason I&#39;m here now is because you wanted to be an idol.
Without you, the idol &quot;Hajime Shino&quot; wouldn&#39;t exist. I&#39;ve always been considered such a dunce by others, so by now I surely would&#39;ve been left behind in the dust—
I might&#39;ve even stopped trying to catch up to you. I might&#39;ve just given up and cried, all alone. So please... Don&#39;t call your reason boring.

Hajime... Yeah, I understand.
(If I never thought of becoming an idol, I wouldn&#39;t be where I&#39;m at now.)
(I would&#39;ve never met Mitsuru and Nii~chan. I would&#39;ve been living a dull, uneventful life.)
(Becoming an idol was a critical turning point in life for me. Even though my reason for wanting to be one is pretty boring and worthless, I don&#39;t need to keep comparing it to others.)
Well, why don&#39;t we brainstorm ideas for a personalized outfit together? If you don&#39;t mind. You know me too well, anyways...
With you, I feel like I could come up with a design that&#39;s like those idols I&#39;ve always admired—the idols that shine beyond the screen.

Tomoya-kun... Yes, of course! ♪

Location: Starmaker Production Lobby


(I finished brainstorming for my personalized outfit, so I brought all the sheets here but...)
Hibiki-senpai&#39;s not here, huh... Maybe I should&#39;ve just called him upfront on HoldHands.

Hoho. I was wondering who you were searching for—to think that it was me.

Eep! D-Don&#39;t just show up out of the blue! You should&#39;ve just called out to me... Geez.
Here. This is the design for my personalized outfit. I took your advice and such, so I thought I&#39;d better show the final outcome to you.

So you decided on a design that draws inspiration from idols in the end.

Yeah. I&#39;m not able bring out the idol &quot;Tomoya Mashiro&#39;s&quot; character yet... Which is why the classic idol outfit is the best choice!

A wonderful choice. You&#39;re still a blank[1] canvas at the moment; I can&#39;t help but wonder what colors you&#39;ll paint yourself with in the future... I grow more and more eager to observe your growth.

Ahaha. I&#39;m also looking forward to what my future as an idol holds.
This is only the first step... With this costume, I shall march towards that future with confidence!


	

Translation Notes
↑ A play on Tomoya's last name, Mashiro (真白). It can be translated as &quot;pure white&quot; or &quot;blank.&quot; This ties back to the story's title, To the Deutzia-Colored You, which appears to be from Wataru's point of view.]]></content>

Alright! Good work today, everyone!

Yeah, see you tomorrow!

Good work today.

Good work.
......
(Everyone went home already, but I still want to practice a bit more.)
U-Umph!

......

You&#39;re the audience today, NeneRobo, so...
Please watch me sing.

......

—♪
(It&#39;s alright. I&#39;m able to sing on stage. But...)
(I wonder if I&#39;m able to sing the same way in front of an audience. What if I mess up again...?)
Whew...
Thank you all for listening.
I can finally stand on stage by myself. But I think this was all thanks to NeneRobo being there for me.
I guess that&#39;s why I&#39;d get scared every time I got near the stage... Because you weren&#39;t there with me.

......I see, I see.

...Eep!?

So that&#39;s the reason why you kept bringing her around, even though she already finished her job.

W-Where the hell did you come from...?

Hehe. I just happened to be here, so it&#39;s the perfect time to make the &quot;surprise visit&quot; trope a reality.

The hell?

Now, now. Apologizes that it seemed like I was eavesdropping.
I have a present for you, see? Your favorite grapefruit juice!

Are you trying to fool me now?

Heheheh, I suppose you could say that.
However...
Despite not using her on stage anymore, it looks like you&#39;re taking good care of NeneRobo.

......

It&#39;s safe to say that this robot completed her role and fulfilled your dream.
But she&#39;s not leaving the stage as long as she&#39;s needed.

What do you mean by that?

I have a proposal. Will you allow me to keep this robot for a while?

Huh? Are you gonna remodel it?

I would never do that. Rather, I&#39;m going to add some improvements to her.

&quot;Improvements&quot;...?

She&#39;s a very high performing robot. I&#39;ll think of ways to make her more user friendly.
That way, you&#39;ll have full control of her and can stand on stage together.

You&#39;re alright with that?

Of course. It&#39;s a director&#39;s responsibility to lend an ear to their performers.

...Mhm.
But if you add anything weird, I&#39;ll get pissed. Got it?

With that, the meeting is now in session!
I want to add some novel, never-before-seen acts in our upcoming show. Give me some ideas on what you&#39;d like to see in it!

...Uhm.

Oh, oh! I got one! We can all start flying across the sky!

Hmm... Well, it&#39;s pretty flashy, but it&#39;s not original at all! Step it up a notch!

We could all explode then!

How is exploding supposed to help us!?

Going &quot;KABOOM!&quot; is undoubtedly really flashy and striking! We could use something like colored smoke!
Oh! And I&#39;ll be red!

Hold on, I&#39;m supposed to be red! Leaders have been associated with red since ancient times!
However, if the smoke is too flashy, the audience wouldn&#39;t be able to see the stage... Your idea has been rejected—once again!
Who else would like to share?

...I hav—

I got another! Let&#39;s just explode without the smoke!

Enough with the explosions!

...Could you ple—

Everyone, it appears that Nene has an ingenious idea.

M-Mmph!?

(Did that guy just shove a donut right into Emu&#39;s mouth at lightning speed!?)

M-Mmmph...? Nom nom nom...

Your turn, Nene.

(That was so unnecessary.)
 Rui&#39;s been adding some improvements to NeneRobo...
 So that we can both stand on stage together...
(Tsukasa would much rather be the one in the spotlight instead of a robot, so I doubt he&#39;ll agree. But...)

NeneRobo, huh? Right. What kind of acts will it do?

 ...Eh?
(Wait, that&#39;s a good reaction... I think.)
 Err... Um... That&#39;ll depend on what Rui&#39;s adding in.

Well, then. How about this? First, we&#39;ll have her go onstage by herself...


I see, I see! How interestin&#39;! I&#39;ll sink about it!

Don&#39;t you mean &quot;think&quot;!?
Regardless, this is a never-before-seen act. You got my seal of approval!

...I&#39;m glad.

I wonder what kind of things NeneRobo-chan can do? This&#39;ll be fun!

Surely. Do look forward to it.

...Mm.

In any respect, I shall always be the star of the stage, no matter what improvements were made!

Shut up, Flopstar.

F-Flop!?

&quot;Flop&quot;...? Okay, you&#39;ll be Mister Flala today!

Why me!?

It&#39;s such a syncopated name though, Mister Flala.

Y-You all better stop!
Do not give me a foolish, unrefined nickname!

But Flala, you aren&#39;t foolish; you are a fool.

Why y—on top of calling me a fool, you even removed the &quot;mister&quot;!

Flala-flala, lop-lop, fla-la-la-lop~♪

Stop, stooop! Don&#39;t you dare make it into an arcane song and dance to ittttt!

......Heh.

 1/3

&quot;G-Good mornin&#39;, Stepmother.&quot;
Ugh... That came out stiff, huh.
&quot;Good morning, Stepmother.&quot; Alright, now that&#39;s more like Cinderella...♪

Nope. Not even close. Shall I show you an example of how to do it?

Possibility 1Possibility 2Alright, sur— Wait, why are you acting all excited before I finished my sentence?!
Well, you are the club president after all.
So of course you can act Cinderella better than me. I&#39;m still learning, y&#39;know.
S-Sure...
What, I&#39;m too straightforward? And you&#39;re a good-for-nothing pervert.
I have little confidence in my acting, y&#39;know?

&quot;Morning, Cinderella.&quot;

Possibility 1Possibility 2Woah, it&#39;s the Masked Pervert— I-I mean, Stepmother.
Yeah, yeah. I know, the show starts soon.
 I gotta play Cinderella perfectly.
What was that for?! It&#39;s not morning anymore...
 Huh? ...Ah, so you were replying as the Stepmother.
Ughh~ I can&#39;t get into my role at all.

 2/3

Let&#39;s see... So I&#39;m Cinderella, Hokuto-senpai&#39;s the First Prince...
 Hasumi-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai are the stepsisters, Kiryu-senpai&#39;s the Second Prince...
And the Masked Pervert&#39;s both the Stepmother and Fairy Godmother. It&#39;ll be alright. I got this.

&quot;Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo♪&quot;

Possibility 1Possibility 2Gwah?! Wait, I don&#39;t want flowers—
 ...I lost a point? It wasn&#39;t Cinderella-like?
Urgh... I didn&#39;t act quickly enough, so I can&#39;t blame you for deducting points.
Err, you did magic right now so...
&quot;Thank you, Fairy Godmother. With this, I can go to the ball.&quot;
 Heheh. Ask and you shall receive!

&quot;Is everything nice and clean, Cinderella?&quot;

Possibility 1Possibility 2&quot;I finished cleaning not so long ago.&quot;
 &quot;I&#39;ll be preparing your meal next.&quot;
...Hm? Oh, I just acted out what I think Cinderella would say.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Stepmother.&quot;
 &quot;I tripped on a bucket of water and flooded the hallway...&quot;
Hmm. It&#39;s better to do nothing if I&#39;m just going to break the dishes and dirty the laundry.

 3/3

Breathe in... Breathe out...♪
 Alright, I&#39;m all fired up now. Time to show the audience what all that practicing was for!
...Ugh, I&#39;m still as nervous as before. Am I even gonna make it to the end?

There's no need to fret. I'm sure you can do it.

Possibility 1Possibility 2I know. You gave me this role because you knew I could do it.
Hmm, even though it feels like you just gave it to me for your own amusement...
 I still hope you have high expectations for me!
...Thank you, President.
It feels weird to express my thanks to you so openly but...
 I&#39;m doing my best, so keep your eyes on me, okay?

Believe in yourself.

Possibility 1Possibility 2...I guess.
 I can&#39;t get into my role if I don&#39;t have any confidence in myself.
I would just have to believe that I could do it.
Believe in...myself?
That&#39;s surprising for you to say... Since you&#39;re nothing even like what a club president should be.
 But I guess what you said resonates[1] with me. Just a little bit.

                        I'm the guy who wrote Dead End Land~ While researching to decide on a chapter name, I came across the idiom "生死妄念." Meaning "to be lost[1] in your destructive thoughts forever, even when you reincarnate," which suits Mayoi perfectly! He's literally the personification of it! (He's not)

                        I'm the writer for Phantom Thieves vs. Detectives. Just like Tomoya, I got sick and collapsed while writing this. I apologize for the inconvenience to those involved. (Starting 2016 with an apology)
