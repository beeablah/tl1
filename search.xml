Writer&#39;s Comment
I was the guy in charge of writing Dead End Land~ While researching to decide on a chapter name, I came across the idiom &quot;生死妄念.&quot; Meaning &quot;to be lost[1] in your destructive thoughts forever, even when you reincarnate,&quot; which suits Mayoi perfectly! He&#39;s literally the personification of it! (He&#39;s not)  ➹

Translation Notes
    
        ↑ "迷まよい" (mayoi) is translated as "lost" here, but it can also mean doubt, delusion, etc. In Buddhism, it refers to the inability to reach enlightenment.

氷に閉じこめて (Koori ni tojikomete) / Locked in Ice
Series: PromareArtist: SuperflyLyrics, composition: Shiho Ochi


漢字RomajiEnglish君は氷のように　冷たいけど炎のような愛じゃ　解けちゃうけど
魔法に掛かるからまだ　愛してもいいかな
見透かされてるようで　苦しいからいつも遠い場所に　逃げちゃうのね
魔法に掛けられてもっと　いい子にしてるからまだ　信じても良いかな
私を凍らせて　今すぐ嘘も本当も　抱き締めてあげるから行かないで　消えないであの街の　雪の中に光など見つけないでよ
君がいなくなると　灰になるの燃え上がる想いが　焼き尽すの
もう一度　夢が叶うなら幸せに還りたい待っててもいいかな愛は生き延びるはず
氷に閉じこめて　この手が頬に心に　触れられるその瞬間ときまで解けないわ　泣かないわ美しき　氷の鎧最後まで君を待ってる
氷に閉じこめて　この手が頬に心に　触れられるその瞬間ときまで解けないわ　泣かないわ美しき　氷の鎧最後まで君を待ってるKimi wa koori no you ni tsumetai kedoHonoo no you na ai ja tokechau kedo
Mahou ni kakaru karaMada ai shitemo ii kana
Misukasareteru you de kurushii karaItsumo tooi basho ni nigechau no ne
Mahou ni kakerareteMotto ii ko ni shiteru karaMada shinjitemo ii kana
Watashi wo koorasete ima suguUso mo hontou mo dakishimete ageru karaIkanaide kienaideAno machi no yuki no naka niHikari nado mitsukenaide yo
Kimi ga inaku naru to hai ni naru noMoeagaru omoi ga yakitsukusu no
Mou ichido yume ga kanau naraShiawase ni naritaiMattetemo ii kanaAi wa ikinobiru hazu
Koori ni tojikomete kono te gaHoho ni kokoro ni furerareru sono toki madeTokenai wa nakanai waUtsukushiki koori no yoroiSaigo made kimi wo matteru
Koori ni tojikomete kono te gaHoho ni kokoro ni furerareru sono toki madeTokenai wa nakanai waUtsukushiki koori no yoroiSaigo made kimi wo matteruYou&#39;re as cold as ice butThe fire of love would melt you down
But since you cast a spell on meI wonder if it&#39;s okay to love you
It&#39;s painful having your true feelings revealedSo you always run away to some place far away
I&#39;m a much better kidBut since I&#39;m under your spellI wonder if it&#39;s okay to believe you
Freeze me right nowI&#39;ll embrace your truths and liesDon&#39;t go, don&#39;t disappearDon&#39;t find the lightAmidst that snowswept town
If you leave, I&#39;ll be reduced to ashesThese blazing feelings for you will burn to nothing
If dreams can come true againThen I&#39;d like to go back to being happyI wonder if it&#39;s a good idea to waitI know our love will survive
Lock me in ice; I won&#39;t melt, I won&#39;t cryUntil the moment my handGets to touch your cheeks and heartI&#39;ll wait for you until the very endIn this beautiful cage made of ice
Lock me in ice; I won&#39;t melt, I won&#39;t cryUntil the moment my handGets to touch your cheeks and heartI&#39;ll wait for you until the very endIn this beautiful cage made of ice

    <content><![CDATA[An apple a day keeps anyone away, if you throw it hard enough.
Series: Ace AttorneySource: Nintendo DREAM July 2016 IssueCharacters: Phoenix Wright, Trucy WrightSpecial Thanks: Lloyd






    
    Trucy
    
        The question is, "What is your favorite food or drink and why?"
    



    
    Phoenix
    
        My favorite food, huh...
    



    
    Trucy
    
        It's apples, right, Daddy?
    



    
    Phoenix
    
        Well, I don't hate them.
    



    
    Trucy
    
        It must feel nice crunching through all that "red stuff."[1]
        Though, you said it would be even better if it had white frills[2] on it.
    



    
    Phoenix
    
        Wait, I don't remember saying that.
    



    
    Trucy
    
        Huh?
        Didn't you eat apples a lot after trials back then?
        You bit into them with a glare as if it's your enemy.
    
    
        ...Or at least, that's what I heard from Miss Fey.
    



    
    Phoenix
    
        M-Maya...
        Trucy, you really shouldn't trust her.
    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ 赤いヤツ can also be translated as "red guy."
    
    
        ↑ 白いヒラヒラ = white frills. Often used to describe Edgeworth's jabot cravat.

  Tomoya
  
     I'm Tomoya Mashiro from Rhythm Link and the unit Ra*bits, which has a theme of being "small and cute." I might be more "average" than everyone else... However, my willingness to put a smile on all our fans' faces is unmatched! I'm still a bit unreliable, but I'll definitely grow into a magnificent idol that you'll be proud of, so please give me your support! Thank you...♪
  



  
  Mitsuru
  
     Tomo-chan's kinda like a mom, since he's always naggin' me around. But he only tells me off when I do somethin' bad, so I'm super thankful for that~♪ It always feels like I'm gonna dash off and leave everyone behind, so Tomo-chan being there to hold me back is a really good thing! I wanna be friends with him forever and ever~!
  


Home ScreenSpring

Morning
(Yawns) ...Oh, sorry. It&#39;s just so warm—I can&#39;t pay attention. I need to concentrate...
Whoa, is that Mitsuru running while half-asleep...?! Mitsuru, stooop! That&#39;s dangerous!


Noon
It&#39;s so warm that I can&#39;t focus... If only Hibiki-senpai were here to do a magic trick... That&#39;ll wake me up.
Looking at the freshmen makes me remember how I was like back then, all naive and innocent... I think it&#39;s too early for me to feel nostalgic, though.


Evening
Of course I&#39;ve grown since last spring! By a centimeter...
Nii~chan visited us at school the other day, but he got mistaken for a new student...


Night
&quot;In spring, the dawn—when the slowly paling mountain rim is tinged with red, and wisps of faintly crimson-purple cloud float in the sky,&quot; huh? I&#39;ll be performing in a play based off The Pillow Book. Would you like to see it?
I have to think of a way to make the best use of Ra*bits&#39; gimmick, even with all these cute, little freshmen out and about.



Summer

Morning
Mitsuru&#39;s still running around without a hat on in this heat... I guess he&#39;s still not going to wear one, no matter what the season is.
Wrapping a wet towel around your neck really helps cool you down. You should try doing that while waiting in-between jobs.


Noon
Hokuto-senpai said that eating umeboshi is a good way to beat the summer heat, so I&#39;m having umeboshi rice balls for lunch today.
I took one of the fans that were being handed out. Please have a seat and relax, I&#39;ll fan you.


Evening
Hajime brought me some cold herbal tea. Do you want a drink? It&#39;s really good♪
I gotta keep up with all of my homework. It wouldn&#39;t look good if the class president forgot to do it...


Night
I&#39;m gonna visit a farm with ANIMALS next break. It&#39;ll be a nice change of scenery♪
I shouldn&#39;t turn down the AC just because it&#39;s hot... It wouldn&#39;t be good for Ayase-senpai, who&#39;s in the same room.



Other

Christmas: Merry Christmas♪ When I woke up, there was a present for me with &quot;Amazing!&quot; written on the tag.
Idle 2: Did you forget about me...? Well, I am still pretty plain, I guess...

     Really? Maybe it's 'cause you have more stuff to do at work, you've been spendin' less time at school.

     Nii~chan, there's a lot more things we can do now that we're under an agency! I'd love to take up a job that's out of the ordinary!

     "A job that's out of the ordinary"... Why don't you star in a variety show with someone as unique as Wataru-chin?

    <content><![CDATA[Riamu just wants some friends.
I&#39;ll recreate the subbed video one day.
Series: THE IDOLM@STER: Cinderella GirlsCharacters: Akari Tsujino, Akira Sunazuka, Riamu YumemiTLC: Koi






    
    Riamu
    
        Sigh, I'm depressed. Being an idol isn't fun at all.
        I knew it would suck, but...
        This is depressing. This is just fucking depressing!
        
    
        Aaah, I want someone to comfort me!
        To keep me company, to give me attention, to tell me everything's alright...
        I want it! I wanna be idolized!
    
    
        ...But no one's ever going to idolize me or whatever.
        This break room's walls are the only friends I have!
        Aaah, I'm sooo lonelyyyy!
    



    
    Akari
    
        Akira-chan, here!
        This is the break room everyone's talking about!
    



    
    Akira
    
        I see.
        #BreakRoom #AKA
        #GameRoom #FunTimesWithEveryone
    



    
    Akari
    
        But I don't think this is a game room...
        Ah! It's Riamu-san!
        Riamu-saaan, good work out there!
    



    
    Akira
    
        Good work.
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Eh!?!?
        ...Huh? Is this a dream?
        Is someone calling me?
        Is this a dream...?
    



    
    Akari
    
        ......?
    



    
    Akira
    
    ......
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Why aren't you guys saying anything?!
        You're being awfully silent! It's suffocating!
        Can't you be a little bit nicer to me?
    



    
    Akari
    
        Hmm... Ah!
        Riamu-san, thank you for performing with us in our last gig♪
    
    
        There were so many other idols!
        The city's amazing as well!
        It was quite enjoya-ple!
    
    
        What about you, Akira-chan?
    



    
    Akira
    
        Well, that was the first time I had this feeling...
    
    
        Also, there were a lot of idols wearin' good clothes...
        Lots of nice clothes.
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Ehh, it wasn't good enough for me.
        I wanna stand out and get a shit ton of attention...!
    



    
    Akari
    
        Wow... Amazing, Riamu-san...
        You're really unique, and you have a nice dream too.
        I guess that's what being an idol is all about.
    



    
    Akira
    
        I wouldn't say that her dream's that great...
        She definitely has personality, though.
    



    
    Akari
    
        Ugh, I wonder if I can match up to you...
        I'm not the type that stands out too much, y'know?
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Alright then! Let's stir up some drama while we're at it!
        As long as we're together, we'll be fine!
    



    
    Akari & Akira
    
        ...Huh?
    



    
    Akari
    
        No, no! You can't just start drama...!
        All the things you care about will go to waste!
    



    
    Riamu
    
        But there are so many other idols out there!
        If you don't stand out as much as possible, you won't survive!
        Hey, Riamu-chan wants to survive!
    



    
    Akira
    
        Don't.
        Stirrin' up drama will just cause trouble for the agency.
    
    
        Aren't there other ways you can think of to survive?
    



    
    Riamu
    
        I wanna stand out! With drama!
        Isn't starting drama mental?
        I wanna stand out as a joke!
    



    
    Akira
    
    Eh...
    Riamu-san, why are you so problematic...?
    



    
    Riamu
    
        It's because I wanna stand out!
        Because I want people to care about me!
        Because I wanna get some attention, at least!
    



    
    Akira
    
        If it's like that, then there should be another way.
        With drama, you'd constantly have to worry about dealin' with radical opinions.
    



    
    Riamu
    
        ...So, I should just join the military.
    



    
    Akari
    
        The military!? What the he—
        Ah, I mean, why?
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Because people in the military are really smart, obviously!
        Let's come up with some genius ideas that'll turn me into a cool officer character!
    
    
        I'm 19, y'know!?
        I want my juniors to rely on me!
        I wanna make you two happy!
    



    
    Akari
    
        W-What should we do, Akira-chan?
        Riamu-san saying all of that isn't any good!
    



    
    Akira
    
        Hey, both of you calm down.
    
    
        First off, it makes no sense to havin' a panic attack here.
        Don't people relax here?
    



    
    Akari
    
        T-That's right! Ahahahaha!
        I just started panicking all of a sudden!
        Uh... Hm... Eh...
    
    
        Ah!
        Why don't we get some ramen?
    



    
    Akira & Riamu
    
        Ramen?
    



    
    Akari
    
        Let's go eat!
        Eating tasty food with friends always cheers me up!
    
    
        Cheer up, Riamu-san.
        Your problematic thoughts might go away!
    
    
        Besides, Tokyo's ramen always looked so trendy and delicious. I've always wanted to try it...!
    



    
    Akira
    
        Ah... In that case, I know a good place.
        It's from my hometown that just opened a Tokyo branch...
        But I guess that isn't really Tokyo ramen, huh.
    



    
    Akari
    
        Aha♪ As long as it's good, it's OK!
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Eh, huh!? What the hell!?
        I'm gonna eat ramen with someone...!?
        Is this a dream? A dream to end all dreams!?
    



    
    Akira
    
        This is reality.
    



    
    Akari
    
        Riamu-san, let's go as a grou-ple♪
    



    
    Riamu
    
        You're joking... You're seriously not joking...?
        Idols are so nice...
        I wuv nice idols...!

Series: Ensemble Stars!Writer: AkiraCharacters: Mika Kagehira, Tomoya MashiroTLCs: Iridesenescence, euni2319QC: Jay





Season: WinterLocation: Shopping Mall - First Floor




The next day, after school



    
    Mika
    
        (Haaah... This ain't any good. 'M not gettin' anywhere...)
        (I couldn't finish the new outfits in time, so we gotta settle with our usual ones fer tomorrow's live.)
        (Even though it's gonna be Oshi-san's last performance as part of Valkyrie an' all...)
    
    
        (But I reckon it's fine, though Oshi-san used to hate havin' to wear the same outfit over 'n over again.)
        (We've been short on money for a lotta reasons, so this ain't nothin' new.)
        (Those outfits're the first thing to come to mind when people think of Valkyrie... The fans'll probably be real happy to see 'em.)
        (They're better than the crappy ones I made, anyways.)
    
    
        (Valkyrie'll come to an end without mixin' in nothing unnecessary, maintainin' the essence of Oshi-san's style all the while.)
        (And that's alright. It's a happy ending... We managed t'make it this far, despite havin' hit rock bottom before.)
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Huh? Heeey, Kagehira-senpai! Were you just about to leave?
    



    
    Mika
    
        Ngah? We've been seein' each other a real lot lately, Tomoya-kun. Whatcha doin' here? This place's pretty far from school.
        The apartment I'll be movin' into in spring's nearby, so I was just checkin' this place out.
        I've been puttin' it off 'til now, but I figured it's 'bout time to start pickin' out furniture.
    





    
    Tomoya
    
        Ohh, is that so... I'm just a regular shopper~ My family comes to this mall every once in a while.
        We just finished buying everything we need, so I'm carrying our stuff to the car.
    



    
    Mika
    
        I see... Ya sure have a lotta bags to carry there.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah... Ah! Wait, I didn't buy this plush for myself, okay?! My little sister's just a big fan of President Hibiki...!
    



    
    Mika
    
        Ahaha, nobody's askin' 'bout that. Ain't it fine, though? Just buy whatever ya like.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ugh... We tend to get too excited in places like this and end up buying lots of unnecessary things.
        The word "sale" is my family's biggest weakness!
    



    
    Mika
    
        Ah, right. Ya did say yer with yer family. Where're they, anyways?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ah, I think they're looking at the store over there. Can you see them?
    



    
    Mika
    
        Hm...? Sorry, I don't think I do.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yep... We're all "normal," so we blend right into the crowd.
        It's not the best trait to have as an idol... I envy you, Kagehira-senpai. People have been staring and whispering things about you for quite some time.
    



    
    Mika
    
        Eh? Oh, yer right. There're some kids pointin' 'n squealin' over there.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You just noticed that?
    



    
    Mika
    
        Yeah, I was real deep in thought. Agh, I don't like bein' stared at...
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I heard Valkyrie's really popular lately, so you're becoming more famous day by day.
        If you're not in disguise, you'll cause an uproar in places like this.
        You already stand out quite a lot as is.
    



    
    Mika
    
        Err, ya think so? My mismatched eyes really are weird, huh?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        No, that's not it. It's more like, your eyes are very attractive... Even though I'm a guy, I find you really good-looking! I get the chills every time I watch you perform!
        If I were a girl, I'd fall in love with you the moment you start singing!
    



    
    Mika
    
        Whatcha mean by that...? Wait, ya watch our lives? Thank ya kindly~♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah, I've been keeping an eye on you guys for quite a while now. Though, you two only ever pay attention to Nii~chan, I think.
        But Valkyrie's still our number one enemy—a wall we absolutely have to climb over.
        There's no way we'd let ourselves be defeated. No, not just that—I want to make sure that Ra*bits is better than Valkyrie before Nii~chan graduates.
    



    
    Mika
    
        ...Ngah?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        We have to! Otherwise, it'll seem like Nii~chan transferring from Valkyrie to Ra*bits was a mistake, right?
        He's always been working so desperately. All the hardships he's gone through in the course of this year... I don't want him to think of it as a waste of time.
    
    
        Sorry to keep talking on and on by myself. But ultimately, that's why...
        In the end, we, Ra*bits, are going to beat Valkyrie one-on-one. At least once.
        The Repayment Festival is our last chance we have left to do this...
        I don't know if you guys are performing or not, but it would be great if we can have a showdown there.
        If you are, please don't go easy on us.
    



    
    Mika
    
        ...Ya think y'can beat us? Even though yer nothin' but cute lil' bunnies?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        But we're the very bunnies Nii~chan trained for a whole year.
    
    
        Oh shoot, my family finished shopping before I realized. They're leaving without me, so I have to go now!
    



    
    Mika
    
        Hey, wait! We ain't performin' in—
    
    
        (...Aaand there he goes. Reckon I'll bump into others if I chase him in this crowd.)
        (He sure is quick as a bunny~)
    
    
        (What was that anyways? Was he tryin' to pick a fight?)
        ("Ra*bits beating Valkyrie"? Now that's a first. There ain't no way that can happen, yeah? Not when Valkyrie—Oshi-san's the strongest! He's invincible!)
    
    
        (That's how things should be, but... Honestly, I got a lil' bit scared there...)

    <content><![CDATA[Teru makes a painful discovery.
Something super short I translated back in 2018, but refined. Happy birthday, Kaoru.
Series: THE IDOLM@STER: SideMCharacters: Kaoru Sakuraba, Teru Tendo, Tsubasa Kashiwagi






    
    Teru
    
        Ow ow ow ow...! That huuurt...
        



    
    Tsubasa
    
        What's wrong, Teru-san? Did you get injured somewhere?
    



    
    Teru
    
        Nah, it just hurts if I press down on my skin here. I think it's a pressure point.
        Hey, Sakuraba. Do you know which body part this pressure point connects to?
    



    
    Kaoru
    
        Dunno. It's probably a stupid one since it's you.
    



    
    Teru
    
        What!? Hmm... If it's gonna be like that, I wonder how you'll react.
        If you feel pain when I press here, then it means you're also stupid! Take that!
    



    
    Kaoru
    
        I-It doesn't hurt... I really don't feel any pain... I'm fine! Let me go at once...!
    



    
    Teru
    
        Wow, seriously hiding the pai—
    
    
        Oww!? S-Stop! Sakuraba!
    



    
    Tsubasa
    
    I guess it hurts just a bit... I wonder which pressure point it is? I'm curious.

    <content><![CDATA[In which the Ninja Association takes up tasks from their newly made request box.
Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: Seitaro KinoCharacters: Mayoi Ayase, Shinobu SengokuTL: KagehirinTLC: HoliQC: Ren





Season: SummerLocation: Yumenosaki Academy




One day in an empty classroom after summer vacation



    
    Shinobu
    
        Mayoi-dono~! Mayoi-dono, might you happen to be present?
    
    
        Hm? It appears that no one is here. We made an appointment to meet in the empty classroom after school, but have I arrived here first?
    



    
    ???
    
        Pant, pant...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Oh...? Is the sound of breathing perhaps coming from...
        ...the inside of that broom closet!?
    



    
        Mayoi
    
        Chiiiief! I knew you'd notice meeeeee♪ You saw right through my camouflage!
        As one would expect from the Ninja Association's leader! I'll follow you for the rest of my life♪
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hehe. My suspicions were correct. It is unthinkable for a reliable person like you to have been late to our meeting, so I knew something had to be up.
    
    
        Anyway, Mayoi-dono, let us begin our club activities for today!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Certainly, let's. Will we be checking the request box today as well?
        I'll start up the PC, and... Oh my, it looks like we received two submissions.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ooh, what a success! We just set it up this week, but we have already received two submissions... It appears our efforts have been noticed!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Receiving anonymous requests like this is fun... It feels quite ninja-like.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Well, to be precise, it is hero work. But it fits us too, since we're ninjas of justice♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        "Hero" work?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ah, it makes sense that you would not know about this. Last year, Morisawa-dono opened a request box and used it to help those in need~
        There was no one to take it over after he graduated, and thus, I received permission to do so.
    
    
        Morisawa-dono looked delighted; he even said, "It's wonderful that you're reaching out and helping others!"
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I see... So you're carrying on his legacy.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Well, it is not as if I am only doing this out of a sense of justice like Morisawa-dono did; I'm not nearly as saintly, after all...
    
    
        ...Because someday, the Ninja Association will become the Ninja Club!
        If we become an official school club, we will undoubtedly gain more members, and we can receive plenty of funding. It will be just one good thing after another!
        As the head of the Ninja Association, it is natural for that to be my goal!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ufufu. Even if your aim is to obtain a reward, it doesn't change the fact that you're performing good deeds.
        If you need stealth, leave it to me. It's a bad habit of mine to flee and hide when I encounter others, but in the context of being a "ninja," that weakness becomes a strength.
    
    
        And I'd certainly rather be a "ninja" than a "phantom"...♪
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        "Phantom"...?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Oh, it's nothing. Just a personal matter.
    
    
        Ah, oops. Chatting with you is so fun that I ended up prolonging our discussion... Shall we take a look at what we received in the request box?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ah, yes. We should do that.
    
    
        So, what does the box contain this time?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        The first submission is a request to help clean things up around the school. Judging from the manner of speech, it seems to be from the person who sent in a request earlier this week[1] as well.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ooh, it surprises me that we'd get a repeat requester.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Indeed. Perhaps they have been trying to support the Ninja Association by bringing us jobs to help us establish a track record.
        I am unsure of who it is, but if they want the Ninja Association to become a real club, they could be someone within Yumenosaki Academy.
    
    
        Ufufu. It's like they're our "Daddy-Long-Legs"[2]—our mysterious benefactor...♪
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hmm. If that is the case, I feel it would certainly be more fun if they could join the Ninja Association and partake in our activities...
    
    
        No, this also depends on the time frame it is occurring in. Perhaps it could be someone like Mayoi-dono!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
    Huh? M-Me...?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Of course~ I never expected a third year to join the Ninja Association.
        When I think of how I am able to spend this much time with a companion of mine, my heart overflows with gratitude♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        C-Chiiiiief...♪ (hugs)
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Mayoi-dono~♪ (hugs back)
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ufufu. To be on a honeymoon with Chief, with no one getting in our way... It's comfortable to the point where I'd be just fine dying in your aaaaarms...♪
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        You mustn't be so hasty! The pair of us are fated companions who have finally managed to cross paths. It is too early to reach the end of our journey!
        There was another request, yes? If so, we must fulfill our duty and be of service.
    
    
        Look, I see another message there. Given the title, I'm quite curious as to what it may contain.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Let's see... Oh, what's this...?
        "A Request to the Members of the Ninja Association: Participate in Our Grand Opening Event"...?
    



    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ In-game, the request is said to be from "last week." However, as Shinobu established earlier, the request box was only set up "this week." It was decided that for the sake of consistency and making any sort of sense, we would write it as "earlier this week" in this chapter. This will be fixed if there are any official changes later on.
    
    
        ↑ A reference to a novel of the same name, in which a girl from an orphanage is given money by an unknown benefactor so that she can go to college. Though she is not allowed to know who he is, it's revealed at the end that a man she met during her time in college and grew attached to was her benefactor.

Season: SummerLocation: Saison Avenue




A few days later



    
    Mayoi
    
        Aah—eep...!?
    
  
        Urgh... People are terrifying... A shopping district like this is simply hell...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Well, experience is the best teacher. I was not terribly good with crowds either, but recently I've been getting a bit more used to them.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I-I see. I feel like no matter what I do, I still end up feeling sick in crowded places...
    
  
    Chief. Would you mind if I took a quick break on that bench over there?
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        That's fine with me~ I shall contact our client to let them know that we will meet up here instead.
    



    
        Mayoi
    
        I-I'm sorry... I probably come off as a terribly feeble individual.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Please don't push yourself too much. You are my one and only companion in the Ninja Association!
    
    
        Ah, right. There is a vending machine close by, so I will go grab something for you to drink. I'm sure that if you hydrate yourself a bit, you will feel better...♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I'm dreadfully sorry for everything I keep putting you through. Thank you very much...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        We have each others' backs~ Well then, I will be right back.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ......
    
  
        (Eek!? S-Someone sat down next to me... Why, for what reason? There should be other empty benches available if they wanted to sit...)
    
  
        (H-Huh? They just said "Good morning," didn't they? To me? I-I wasn't hallucinating, was I...?)
    
  
        (Eep... Is it possibly a fan of mine? I don't feel comfortable just ignoring them, so I should try to say at least something...)
    
  
        D-Do you possibly need something from me...!?
    
  
        Eep! Close, too close! Your face is way too clooooose!
    
  
    Ah, um, I... T-There isn't anything particularly interesting about my face even if you inspect it closely... I think there's some misunderstanding, so please back up a bit...!
  
  
        Oh, Miss Producer...?
    
  
        I-I'm sorry... I'm bad at making eye contact with people, so I didn't realize it was you.
    Aah... That's why you leaned so close to me? To help me remember who you were? Yes, we have met several times in the ES building, so please pardon my rudeness...
    
  
        ......
    
  
        (What an awkward silence...! Should I try to start a conversation about something...?)
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Oh, you're here, Producer-dono—Anzu-dono. It seems you've already gotten Mayoi-dono to open up♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Aah, Chief! My savior!
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ahaha. You're truly that bad with people?
    
  
    I thought you may have arrived, Anzu-dono, so I bought a bottle of tea for you as well~ Green tea was the only variety available, though.
  
    
        There is no need to offer me words of thanks. You were the one who submitted the request to our box, after all.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ah, you submitted a request anonymously, but then revealed your identity after? I was under the impression that every requester has to remain completely anonymous...
    However, why were we requested for work off-campus?
    
    
        No, it's not that I take any issue with such. I merely thought that it would be connected in some way to our in-school activities.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        That was a curious matter to me as well. Our recent requests have primarily been from ES, so...?
    
  
        Hm? It's quite hard to explain, so you’d like us to follow you to the location itself? I see.
    
  
        Are you alright with that, Mayoi-dono?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        E-Eep. To not know any of the details is exceedingly scary...
    
    
        But I understand. I'll follow your lead. 
    Through fire, through water, until the ends of the Earth...!
    


Location: Dead End Café





    
    Shinobu
    
        This is...?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Err, Miss Producer, what is a "Dead End Café"?
    I understand what cafés are, but not a "dead end" one... Do you think we will be able to serve p-poisoned coffee?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        You never told us that we would be serving poisoned food, Anzu-dono! That is so unpleasant, as the Ninja Association is a wholesome group!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha, you're overthinking it.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ooh...? What brings you here, Mashiro-dono?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        That's my line, Sengoku~ Did Dead End Café reach out to you guys too?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Correct. To be precise, we were referred by Anzu-dono. Did she do the same to you?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah, the Drama Club's also referred by her. These costumes make it the perfect job for us, y'know?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        It truly suits you all, as always~
    
    
        Then, why are you wearing a costume at a café...?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Haha, I'm not so sure about that either.
    Well, the café's theme is something like: a girl wanders into the underworld, where dead servers entertain and cook for her.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hmm, so that is what's popular as of late... Were you aware of such a thing, Mayoi-dono?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        No, I'm not familiar with the trends... But that is a unique theme.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        It really is—Ayase-senpai? You were up early today, but I didn't expect to see you here.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        You were offered the same job too, M-Mashiro-san?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hm? Do you two know each other?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Yes. Everyone in ALKALOID transferred dorms after MDM. Mashiro-san and I have been roommates since then.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Fair enough. You have a surprisingly close friend there.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        N-No, we're not that close! I tend to be extremely shy; therefore, I'm not really familiar with him!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. Please don't be modest. I'm younger than you, so I don't care if you're casual with me, okay?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I-I'm formal by default so it's alright!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. Either way, it's still nice to have someone to talk to.
    Anzu-san, you referred both the Drama Club and the Ninja Association here because of our connection to Yumenosaki, right?
    
    
        I see. So Dead End Café is run by a fellow student's parents.
    We were referred because you heard that our club activities were going well, huh...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        We're under an entertainment agency for the time being. Thus, requesting jobs up-front goes against my moral code...
    
  
        Actually, there doesn't seem to be anyone else from the Drama Club here—
    
  
        Huh? There's something on the ceiling...!
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Ghehe. You have finally noticed me♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
     Eeeek! A-An Eccentric...!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Whoaaa!? H-H-How the hell were you able to stick onto the ceiling, Hibiki-senpai!?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehe, you're too naïve, Tomoya-kun! Since I'm an entertainer, I always have to look for ways to make an amazing entrance☆
    
  
    Now, allow me to properly introduce myself. It has been quite a while, Miss Anzu. I am your Wataru Hibiki...☆
    It appears that there are others with you too. Let us all work hard today!
  



    
    Mayoi
    
     Aaaaaaiiiiiieeeeee!
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Don't be so nervous, Mayoi-dono.
    
    
        There's no need to be so scared of him. How he behaves may be a bit strange, but the Three Eccentrics—including Shinkai-dono—are all charming people.

Season: SummerLocation: Dead End Café




Sometime after the café has opened



    
    Shinobu
    
        Welcome~♪
    Here is your seat, milord. I shall deliver you the menu posthaste!
    
  
    Ah, do pardon me. I lived and died as a ninja. Thus, I unintentionally slip back into my previous way of speaking at times.
  
  
    Right then, I shall be off!
  
  
    Whew... Being both a ninja and a butler is a bit tricky, isn't it?
  
  
    It is also much busier than I was expecting. Is that causing you anxiety, Mayoi-dono?
  



    
    Mayoi
    
        ......
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Alas, it seems I was correct! You appear quite down, Mayoi-dono! Are you alright?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ......
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Mayoi-dono...?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ah, my apologies... The manager told me I'm "really as silent as the dead!" so I've been staring at the floor and making not a single peep, but...
    
  
        Urgh... Is this really okay? Rather, I feel like it gives a strange impression that customers would be more pleased if I acted coldly.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. This kind of role does fit you though, Ayase-senpai. Plus, it balances out with our noisy coworker, so it's fine. You know who I mean, the dead ex-clown—
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Amazing! ☆ It has been a long time since I had contact with the living~
    Were you lured to the underworld by your desire to seek pleasure?
    
  
        I, a failed street performer during my lifetime, have no need to worry about struggling with poverty or how others rate me here!
    We have an eternity! I shall be here for eternity!
    
  
        Hehehe. And when one is trapped in eternity, their conversations do tend to eternally meander. Now then, would you like to order? ☆
    Hm? What do I recommend from the menu?
    
  
        Let's see... If you wish, I could draw a portrait of you with our special sauce!
    I have also long been able to write using grains of rice; detail work is my forte!
    I'm dead, so I can illustrate as many dishes as you wish♪ Afflictions such as fatigue and the cold do not affect me any longer! ♪
    
  
        I see! Two Dead Omurice, coming right up~♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Man, you can tell how damn loud he is just by looking at him.
    
  
        But because he stands out so much, we're going viral on social media.
    There might be an even bigger crowd in the afternoon since he's a special guest for today.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        E-Even bigger...!? Just the thought of it makes me dizzy...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Keep yourself together~ There were far more people in the audience during MDM, so there's no need to be frightened.
    
  
        Oh? Anzu-dono is watching us from the kitchen and smiling.
    
  
        Alright! At this pace, we will become a Ninja Club in a single bound! Let us do our very best!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        U-Um. Chief...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        There is nothing to worry about. You are doing just fine as you are right now, Mayoi-dono♪
    Your outfit suits you well, and when you take up a silent character, the charm of your handsome features only doubles♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        T-Thank you very much...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ah, yes. A new order has come in? I shall excuse myself here, then!
    
  
        Oh, this manner of speech? I lived out my days as a ninja, see—
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ......
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Mister Phantom. You look so miserable that one would think you've fallen into despair. Are you getting into character?
    Hehehe. If so, you've nailed it♪
    
  
        While I am butting into your affairs a bit, won't you listen to the tale I have to tell? It is the way of life for both clowns and actors to perfectly pull off their given roles.
    Play your desired role as how others desire it to be. If you do not, you will bring about complaints that you are "boring," that the audience was "let down"... That is the sad fate of a clown like myself.
    
  
        All humans want to be loved. When a clown is loved, it keeps their art alive. For me, that brings both hope and a feeling of resignation.
    But even having said that, you don't need to go beyond your limits to stand on stage. Those who work behind the scenes have their own happiness.
    
  
        Mister Phantom. While I've been observing you, you've nearly stumbled about two or three times—are you feeling alright?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ...I'm alright. You don't have to worry about that.
    



    
    Wataru
  
        Hm. I see! Do pardon me for sticking my nose where it doesn't belong~☆
    
  
        Tehehe. We have spoken for too long. I tend to get quite in-character for all of my roles.
    I won't be able to write letters on as many omurice as I need to like this.
    
  
        I can handle the customers myself, so... Go help out in the kitchen, if you would please?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ...Understood.
    
    
        ......
    
    
        (You were probably aiming your words at me rather than just telling a story about yourself, weren't you? Hibiki-san.)
        (It's just as you say. I can't become someone like you Eccentrics and the myriad of other geniuses that exist in this world. Anyone having expectations for me is incredibly frightening.)
    
    
        (Because I am a "phantom"—a trivial, hideous existence compared to yours.)
        (I suppose it's a beautiful thing, to play the role you've been called upon to play. But for me...that's too heavy of a burden.)
    
    
        (It may not be the right way to say this, but... Even if it disappoints someone, I don't want to hurt those who love me—)
        (Because I'm a weak, pitiful existence that can't fulfill the role others want me to play.)

10 minutes later



    
    Wataru
    
        Alright, are the two from the Ninja Association finished changing?
    
  
        The grand opening event is soon, so apply your makeup quickly. If you're having trouble, I am willing to be of assistance♪
    I have plenty of experience as an actor, you know. So I can assist with your makeup...♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Nah, you can't just do makeup—you can do pretty much anything.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        I can't just do "anything"! For example, if I were thrown into a blast furnace, even I could only give a thumbs up before sinking.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        That's such a weird scenario, though?
    
  
        Anyways... Don't be afraid to let me know if you're having trouble, Sengoku.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Much obliged. Can you check if I have any stains on the back of my jacket, then?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ah. If I coul—
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Oh my. It's quite rude to interrupt two friends talking, Mister Phantom.
    Let us leave them to themselves and talk about love! I have a feeling you and I are birds of a feather♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Um... Huh...?
    
  
        (Scary! I don't get along too well with this person, but he keeps insisting on getting closer to me?)
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Tehehe. Please don't be afraid! As you are the phantom and I am the clown, don't we both wear a mask?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        W-Where on earth did that pigeon come from...!?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        There aren't any tricks or gimmicks around here, tehe♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Hey, what are you two doing? It's almost time for the grand opening, so please stop fooling around!
    Especially you, Hibiki-senpai! You're only here because Hokuto-senpai couldn't make it! Control yourself!
    You became a full-fledged member of society a long time ago. The academy clearly doesn't have your back anymore.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Ah, the good ol' scolding...☆ However, the real world is far more selective than a school packed with a wide variety of people.
    Even impudent behavior can be shadowed with an impudent environment. That is particularly true in show business—a place out of the ordinary.
    
  
        In retrospect, aren't you still the same old Tomoya-kun? And I don't mean that in a bad way!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You threw that at me so casually... I'm hurt.
    
  
        I mean, just because you said it wasn't "in a bad way" doesn't mean you can just go say whatever the hell you please!
      Like, I was always told that I'm too "normal" since childhood. Poppin' Party[1] would never happen if I was the same as before.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        That's wonderful. You are raising the standards of what's "normal" in your own way~ It's a different approach from merely excelling in a single area, and I think it's commendable.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Whatever you just said pisses me off... But that's just who you are.
    
  
        Sorry for getting carried away, Sengoku. You don't have any stains on your jacket from what I see.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        That's a relief to hear. I finished applying my makeup, so I am all geared up.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ooh, you're pretty good at this.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ryuseitai has done a lot of work in small venues, so I'm rather skilled at getting myself ready.
    Though, I cannot cross-dress, unlike you all in the Drama Club.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I-I'm also done.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        You are all amazing at this! We must make haste now, Miss Anzu is waiting for us.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh, shoot. Is it almost time?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        I hear people discussing the sorts of routines we'll do over there.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        "Routines"...?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Correct. Since we are servers, there is practically no need for us to cook. One of those routines appears to be writing with white sauce[2] in front of the customers.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        It's like what maid cafés do, right? Where they go "moe moe kyun☆" while drawing hearts with ketchup?[3]
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Heheh. Good guess, Tomoya-kun! It's exactly what you say it is!
    As idols and actors, we are sure to be beautiful, graceful, and sometimes adorable! I am certain the customers will be pleased♪
    
  
        To show the others an example, please write "LOVE" in extra-large letters on my omurice...☆
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. This is Dead End Café, so I'll be drawing a skull instead. Is that alright with you? ♪
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Oh my, even how you treat your superiors has changed~ Good grief, who taught you these manners?
    



    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ "Poppin' Party" is the name of Nazuna's welcome back concert that took place in High Five! A pretty significant event for Tomoya, especially since he's performing in it as Ra*bits' new leader.
    
    
        ↑ Also known as béchamel sauce. Often used in omurice, but not really to "write with" unlike ketchup...
    
    
        ↑ "Moe moe kyun" is an incantation to make food taste delicious. It can be localized as "abracadabra" or "bibbidi bobbidi boo," but they don't give the same cutesy vibe. Popularized by K-On!

Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: Seitaro KinoCharacters: Anzu, Mayoi Ayase, Shinobu Sengoku, Wataru Hibiki, Tomoya MashiroTL: RenTLC: HoliQC: haranami, Kagehirin





Season: SummerLocation: Dead End Café





    
    Shinobu
    
        Pant, pant... We somehow managed to sneak inside.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        There sure is a lot of commotion outside... The line seemed to go on forever, but thankfully we were able to enter through the backdoor without being noticed.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh, you're back! Could you clean yourselves up this instant? We need you guys to help out in the kitchen... There's been so many customers going in and out since dinner started—the two of us can't keep up with all the orders!
        Right now, Hibiki-senpai's putting on a show to stall for us. If we can't get the food out in time, the customers would get upset. We gotta turn the tables before that happens.
  
    
        Just look at him. He's been doing that all afternoon.
  



    
    Wataru
    
        Here you are. Now, as a member of the dead, I shall employ my powers to make a drink gush out of this cup♪
        Everyone agrees that this is an empty cup, yes?
  
    
        Say it with me: one, two, amazing...☆
  



    
    Mayoi
    
        No wonder he's an Eccentric...
        Fair is foul, and foul is fair—it is because they're all so incredible that they cannot hide what makes them irregular. It's been a while since I was reminded of this fact.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. More often than not, he overshadows the lead despite being a supporting actor. That guy likes playing comedic roles.
        Actually, with how easily he grabs the spotlight, it's no wonder why he takes the stage! Seriously... He never ceases to amaze everyone.[1]
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        Wait, where does he take it to?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        No, no. That's just theater talk for "he's a really talented guy." Since Hibiki-senpai can pretty much do anything, there's no need for him to rely on any gimmicks.
        But y'know, you can't do a one-man show on the grand stage. There's only one Hibiki-senpai, so of course I have to help him.
  
    
        We each have our own part to play, and we should be able to do what's needed of us... Y'know?
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        Mhm. It's just as you say.
        The same holds true for idols, producers, managers, chefs, servers, customers... No, this goes beyond the restaurant.
        There are so many types of people in this world, how fascinating!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. Ninjas too. They might be hidden, but they're always around.
        Someone could say that only a handful of geniuses are able to stand on stage, but life would have no meaning then~
  
    
        Thus, we are called upon the stage. That includes you too, Ayase-senpai♪
  



    
    Mayoi
    
        Uhmm... I-Is that so?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. It sure is~ Otherwise, I'd just slam the door in your face.
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        Uweh!? Were we not supposed to come back~?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh, that's just an exaggeration. I'm not actually mad or anything of the sort.
    Alright, Ayase-senpai. Go clean yourself up and help out in the kitchen.
  
    
        You can make up for what happened earlier by cooking a good meal for the staff.
        Everybody's been working so hard, after all. It would be such a shame if we didn't at least get compensated with a warm meal made with love.
  



    
    Mayoi
    
        Of course. I apologize for the inconvenience, everyone.
        I'll do my best to fulfill my role. I don't have much confidence in myself, but I can't bear to disappoint all of you even more.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        That's the spirit. Well then, I'm gonna go check on Hibiki-senpai, so the rest is in your hands.
        Same goes to you, Sengoku~
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        Roger that. Doing behind-the-scenes work is my specialty♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Take care, Mashiro-san.
    
    
        ...Hm? You're going to help us too, Miss Producer?
    
    
        About that... Um... You helping out even though it was all my fault... I'm sorry.
    
    
        Huh, you're all prepared!? Since when did you change your clothes!?
    
    
        All you've been doing lately is producer work, so you find this more fun?
        Err, someone like myself has no business saying this, but... You're pretty weird yourself too, huh?
    
    
        I appreciate it.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        (...Hehehe. It appears that it will be smooth sailing from here on out.)
        (It's about time for my curtain call... Perhaps it would be best to wrap things up here?)
        (At this rate, we should be able to resolve all the issues begotten of our lack of staff.)
        (The café has been rather disorderly for quite a while now, but that, too, should be resolved as soon as Tomoya-kun and I take charge.)
  
    
        (But, first, I'd best clear up his misunderstandings. Although I am an actor—a single individual—I am also "your" Wataru Hibiki.)
        (If you believe that I'd do something as "normal" as only playing one role, perish the thought! I shall play three, four—nay, an infinite amount of them!)
        (...If that is what is desired of me by my audience—the you to whom this Wataru Hibiki is dedicated.)
  
    
        Tomoya-kun!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Y-Yeah? You need something?
  



    
    Wataru
    
        There is but one last thing I'd like to request of you. Would you be so kind as to hear me out?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Umm...? Why so sudden? I mean sure, go ahead.
  



    
    Wataru
    
        Thank you. ...Very well then! Ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes as I saw Tomoya-kun in half!
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Huh?
  



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehehe. I suspected something like this may happen, so I even brought along a box and sword for the occasion♪
        The tools have already been prepared, so all that's left is for you to step inside the box...☆
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        No way in hell. What do you mean that you "suspected something like this may happen"?! And why did you even bring those here, Hibiki-senpai?! We are NOT going to put the "dead end" in "Dead End Café"!
  



    
    Wataru
    
        Oh? But I'm certain everyone here would love to see you get sawn in half... Are you really going to refuse them all, Tomoya-kun?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Stop! This isn't funny! Why are you staring at me like th— AaaaaiiiIIIEEEEEEE?!

        ↑ This whole section has been localized in order to convey the meaning better. Here are the unlocalized lines:
    



Tomoya: Actually, with how easily he grabs the spotlight, it&#39;s more accurate to say he&#39;s a projectile. Seriously... He never ceases to amaze everyone.Shinobu: &quot;Projectile&quot;? Such as shuriken and blowguns?Tomoya: No, no. That&#39;s just theater talk for a &quot;colorful&quot; actor. Since Hibiki-senpai can pretty much do anything, there&#39;s no need for him to rely on any gimmicks.

A &quot;projectile&quot; is an actor who surprises their audience with how they act, rather than their actual acting ability. A &quot;colorful&quot; actor would be someone who stands out for their unique acting. Both are considered synonyms for each other. The closest English term for this would be a character actor.

Season: SummerLocation: Dead End Café




A few hours later, during break time



    
    Tomoya
    
        Nice work, everyone~! Man, that was a lot busier than I'd imagined!
    Looks like some people made reservations in advance, but there's already a line for those who couldn't get in during lunch♪
    
  
    Sengoku's role as a former ninja fit the theme well, so the customers were pleased~♪
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        Indeed. It was all swith improvisation, but they welcomed me with open arms.
    One customer happened to be a Ryuseitai fan and ordered a multitude of dishes from me—
    
  
    Namely Dead Omurice, Dead End Parfait, and some Dead Black...coffee. I was also able to chat with them every time they made an order.
  



    
    Wataru
    
        Heheheh, you are surpassing all of my expectations. The Drama Club cannot afford to lose here!
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Of course. I'd say Hibiki-senpai's acting more like support, passing orders from person to person and such.
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        With the kitchen receiving more orders than it can handle, it's as though he's keeping it from spiraling out of control by coordinating magic tricks and small talk.
  



    
    Wataru
    
        That's because my duty is to keep the customers satisfied~ I thought by doing those, I could avoid running into trouble and buy some time.
  
    
        Hehehe. Now that we survived the busy lunch hour without a scratch, let us take a break.
        ...Or at least, that is what I would like to say.
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Hmm?
  



    
    Wataru
    
        Take a look around. Don't you think there's someone missing?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        "Someone missing"... Anzu-san just came out of the kitchen, but that's not exactly "strange"...
        Mayoi-senpai isn't here... Didn't he say that he had to "powder his nose"[1] earlier?
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        He is using the restroom. The door is locked shut.
  



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehehe. I've picked up on something! My hair sensors have been activated...
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        What the actual hell does that even mean!?
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        How remarkable, Hibiki-dono! I thought this ability of yours was just hearsay—I didn't know you were truly capable of this!
  
    
        Perhaps I should've recruited you for the Ninja Association while you were still a student...
  



    
    Wataru
    
        Oops. Haven't you seen this little trick before, Sengoku-kun? It's a bit like applying magic to your hair—but let us return to the matter at hand.
        Judging from the reverberations in the air, there is no one in the restroom...♪ It is likely that Mister Phantom escaped through the window.
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        Egad, you are utterly correct! There is no sign of him behind the door!
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Huh, you can sense that too?
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        Sensing one's presence behind barriers is among the first techniques a ninja must acquire!
  
    
        Anyhow, Mayoi-dono shouldn't have gone too far... I do not know what came over him, but I shall search for him right away!
  
    
        Oh? You want to come along too, Anzu-dono? I appreciate your aid!
  
    
        Hmm. You want me to continue working, so you're going to look for him yourself?
  
    
        ...I cannot let you do all of that alone.
        Mayoi-dono is the only other member of the Ninja Association. I can't abandon him, no matter what the circumstances are.
  
    
        Surely you understand, correct?
  



    
    Wataru
    
        I agree with Sengoku-kun, Miss Anzu.
        As I am an Eccentric, I don't know much about Mister Phantom. Could it be that working with me put a heavy burden on him?
  
    
        However, a play is nothing without actors to perform it. I'm certain that Mister Phantom doesn't want us to continue without our full cast.
        If you find something to be a burden, then I shall shoulder that burden. Such is the grace of having a supporting actor by your side.
  
    
        Leave the café to me. Tomoya-kun, could you give me a hand?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Um... Well... I'm sure Hibiki-senpai will be fine. This dude has ridiculously high stats anyways. You should go focus on finding Ayase-senpai.
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        ...Much obliged. If you insist, I shall search for Mayoi-dono at once!

Depiction of a panic attack ahead



    
    Mayoi
    
        Sob, sob...
    
    
        (Aah... I ran away without changing, so everyone is staring at me... It hurts.)
        (I mean, of course they would be. A grown adult dressed in a strange outfit curled up on a bench, hugging his knees and crying...)
        (But my tears aren't stopping.)
    
    
        (Chiiiief... Please forgive me. I'm such a lowly creature!)
        (But I can't do anything about iiiiit! If things... If things continue like this...!)
    
    
        (I-I can't... I c-can't breathe. I can't remember how to breathe. I feel like my mind's in a haze...)
        (It's impossible for me after all. He—Hibiki-san said that he lives by meeting others' expectations...)
        (But I can't do that.)
    
    
        (...I felt like I was going to lose consciousness several times just from all of the people looking at me.)
        (Surrounded by bright, sparkling people like ALKALOID, I still felt like there was something I could do.)
        (But in a job like this, with all of us working individually to draw our customers' attention, it felt like the burden on me specifically had increased.)
    
    
        (If I continued trying to do my job at the café, I would have collapsed—Dead End Café would take a huge blow, and it would be my fault.)
        (By asking the Ninja Association for a favor, they were taking a risk.)
        (And if I ruined it, the association—a place beloved to me—would certainly crumble and disappear into nothing.)
    
    
        (Even though Chief has been trying so desperately to fulfill his desire of turning it into a real club.)
        (If it comes to that, it'd be better for me to return to the darkness where I once was.)
        (If I can avoid hurting anyone, then living in a desolate place where the light never touches is a much better choice for me.)
    
    
        (You gave me love, so I will sacrifice myself for the sake of that love. The Phantom of the Opera ended things the same way, didn't he?)
        (It doesn't matter how much despair I feel, so long as the one I love can be truly happy. I don't mind if you despise me for running from my responsibilities.)
    
    
        ...Thank you so very much, Chief. Now, it's time to sever the bond between us.
        This is...truly a dead end.
    



    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ Mayoi used "お花を摘みに行く" (lit. to go flower picking) when talking to Tomoya. It's a feminine way to say "I'm going to use the restroom" without specifying the location and act. The more masculine version is "キジ撃ち" (lit. shooting pheasants).

One hour later



    
    Shinobu
    
        He isn't here either... Just where on earth did Mayoi-dono disappear to?
    Anzu-dono, did you spot him on your end?
    
    
        Hm, so you caught neither hide nor hair of him. That's a problem... Mayoi-dono is very good at hiding, which can make it quite difficult for anyone searching for him.
    
    
        Oh, why are you pulling out your phone, Anzu-dono? Do you have some kind of secret strategy?
    I see... Since he's still wearing Dead End Café's uniform, perhaps people will be talking about him on social media?
    
    
        Interesting, this method didn't cross my mind at all!
    I am impressed indeed, Anzu-dono. I was so flustered that such an idea hadn't occurred to me.
    
    
        Alright, I'll do some searching on my phone as well!
    Keyword, keyword... Would something like "ALKALOID" work?
    
    
        Hmmm... I'm not seeing anything. I suppose it isn't that easy. I'll try a different word...
    
    
        Oh? Did you find something, Anzu-dono?
    
    
        Oho... So you found something on a post that mentioned the department store on Saison Avenue. This photo...is certainly of Mayoi-dono, isn't it?
    
    
        Hm...? Why is he curled up on a bench? How strange.
    
    
        No, it won't do any good to make assumptions from the photo. I would like to ask Mayoi-dono himself for details. Let us head to the location in the photo immediately.
    
    
        That was an impressive feat, Anzu-dono. Perhaps it's much like the old saying: "If you want to hide a tree, hide it within a forest"... And if you want to hide a person, do so within a crowd.
        I have just noticed the multitude of "eyes"—phone cameras—pointed at him.
    
    
        It would be good if Mayoi-dono is unharmed despite all the gazes upon him, but...for some reason, I am incredibly concerned.
    


Location: Dead End Café





    
    Tomoya
    
        Welcome~♪
    Yes, the restaurant is full right now. Please put your name on the waiting list, and we'll call you when a table is available.
    
    
        "How long will it take"? Umm, I'd say around 30 minutes. Apologies for the delay.
    
    
        (This is bad... It's impossible to keep up with everything when two of our servers are away...)
    (I wonder if this is too much for even Hibiki-senpai to handle...?)
    



    
    Wataru
    
        (Whispering) Tomoya-kun, Tomoya-kun.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah, what is it, Hibiki-senpai?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        I suddenly feel like putting on a show. Would you be so kind as to become my assistant and lend me a hand?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Hah? Just when I thought you'd say that...
    
    
        Generally speaking, if you were to do that, the table turnover would decrease.
        The people waiting outside would get mad and start filing complaints.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        That is precisely why I want to do it, Tomoya-kun! Please put aside common sense and think for yourself. Now, take a close look around the café...☆
        Although there are no empty seats, there is still an abundance of empty space within the café.
        We can therefore let everyone in and entertain them with a performance as they wait to be seated.
    
    
        Why don't we bet on the possibility that Sengoku-kun will arrive with Mister Phantom before the end of our show? The moment they return, we'll have enough hands to resolve this entire situation.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Eh? Well, it is possible in theory. But...
    



    
    Wataru
    
        "But"? Now, Tomoya-kun, surely you can't be entertaining the possibility of failure?
    
    
        I'm not too fond of boasting, but allow me to remind you that I am the best of the best—that I am one of the Five Eccentrics, Wataru Hibiki!
        I shan't perform for merely 30 minutes, but an hour—no, I could even do this for all eternity!
        Indeed, I could provide everyone with so much amazing, they forget the passing of time itself! ♪
    
    
        Or were you entertaining the possibility that Miss Anzu and the rest won't return in time? Oh dear, I don't recall raising such a heartless child.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Since when did I ever see you as my dad!?
    
    
        ...Fine. Whatever. I'll go along with your plans, if you insist.
        After all, I believe that they'll come back as well.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Splendid! I knew you would say that♪
        Now then, Tomoya-kun, please let everyone in at once! We shall make all of them have the time of their lives—it's showtime! ♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        God, you truly are a natural-born entertainer, huh?
    
    
        Go break a leg, Hibiki-senpai! You better apologize if this show of yours fails!
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehehe. If it came to that, I'd give you permission to boil or burn me, to reprobate me in any way you'd see fit. But fear not, I'd sooner perish than allow such mistakes to occur...
        Though, I'm already dead right now♪
    
    
        Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls—come one, come all! The dead man's act is about to begin! All payments can be made later on♪
        Welcome to Dead End Café's surprise grand opening show! Brought to you by the passerby street performer, your very own Wataru Hibiki...☆

After closing hours



    
    Wataru
    
        Tomoya-kun, what incredible moxie! You had such amazing reactions☆
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ugh, I'm seriously exhausted...
    
  
        I was genuinely terrified! It doesn't matter how much of it was just "magic," I really thought I was gonna have a heart attack!
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hm~ It was because of your dedication to the show that all the customers were able to enjoy it to the fullest, though!
    And so, due to the disorder in the restaurant turning into excitement, we were able to have an extremely satisfying opening event!
    
  
        It was certainly a performance befitting Dead End Café♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Could you not involve me in such a dangerous act without letting me know first!?
    You might've just been pretending to debate with yourself on whether you'd actually shove that sword right through me or not, but I seriously thought I was gonna die!
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehehe. If we are to deceive an audience, it simply must be from atop a stage...♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You can't pull one over on me by trying to say it like it's some proverb, okay!?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Um...
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Whoa!? Were you here the whole time, Ayase-senpai? I didn't notice you at all!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ah, I-I'm sorry for not having much of a presence... Um, as you requested earlier, I prepared some food for the staff; would you like to have some...?
    
  
    No, right, you wouldn't want to go out of your way and eat food that I made, would you!?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Of course I would. Are you having any, Hibiki-senpai?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Certainly~ I am, as one would expect from our series of performances, quite hungry. I will accept with great gratitude.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ahaha. I shall partake in this meal as well♪ You know, Mayoi-dono is so skillful that he was able to master any dish after only reading the menu~
    This recipe for omurice that he adapted from it is his specialty... I absolutely couldn't wait to try it♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Things really do turn out well if you just put the right people in the right jobs, huh?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        The show must go on... On stage, whatever will be, will be.
    It is simply inevitable that you will be involved in such predicaments when performing, Tomoya-kun♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Uh, no. Don't try to justify your actions from earlier.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        F-Feel free to have some as well, Miss Producer... I caused you a great deal of trouble, so at least allow me to treat you to this as an apology...
    I-I hope I'm not being too pushy... Ah, you're hungry, so you'd be happy to have some? Here you are, then.
    





    
    Mayoi
    
        I put all my effort into making this. It's my special omurice.
    Here you go, please enjoy your meal...♪
    
  
    Ufufu, I'm so glad... Just watching everyone eat the food I made is enough to save my soul.
  
  
    But I truly did a terrible thing to you all... Because of this mess, becoming the Ninja Club feels like a distant dream, and the road ahead is but a long and precipitous path.
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        And it is fine that way. All's well that ends well—to travel an even, paved road is unlike a ninja to do.
    The manager looks grateful as well. Though they wondered whether things would turn out all right, this became a good opportunity for publicity, and it seems they had fun, too.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehehe. They've nerves of steel.
    I suppose that if they didn’t, they wouldn't be managing a café as odd as this one.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        I see. Certainly, to have those that take the stage―or rather, ninjas―manage an event is an eccentric idea to have, but...
    The manager also seems to think that things should be done that way, don't they?
    
  
        Surprisingly, I have been told that we may be requested to come back and work here again in the near future. It didn't sound like they were just saying it to be polite.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        R-Really...?
    
  
    If that’s the case, I'm glad to hear it...♪
    Though the existence of idols atop a glittering stage has changed my life...
    I told myself that it would be better for me to return to the darkness.
  
  
    But it would be tactless of me to say that to the Ninja Association… No, to you all.
    If someone, somewhere out there ever requires our aid, we will rush to wherever they may be. That is what we, as the Ninja Association, do—
  
  
    ...Right, Chief? ♪

    <content><![CDATA[Wow. Wataru? Being a proper senpai? It&#39;s more likely than you think.
Phantom Thieves VS Detectives is so dear to me—it&#39;s still my favorite event story so far, even after four years. I was able to get permission to TLC this chapter. There&#39;s quite a lot of major changes to it, but I had fun!

    Tomoya
    
        One, two, three, four! Hop, hop, hop♪
        ...Alright, that's perfect. Tomoya Mashiro has made a full recovery♪
    
    
        (Ra*bits were lucky enough to be the main act for today's live...)
        (I gave it my all in order to keep up with everyone else, but I couldn't show off my strengths.)
    
    
        (Hajime and Mitsuru are improving at such an incredible rate. They always had more potential than me since the very beginning.)
        (I was on break for only a few days, but it's like I've already been left behind.)
    
    
        (I also need to work harder.)
        (The Mystery Stage just reached its turning point. Sena-senpai also said that the "riddles" after today will be even more troublesome.)
        (I don't know if we can successfully crack them like today.)
    
    
        (I need to be prepared for them by the next time we're the main act so that I can show-off myself. Nothing will be lost that way.)
        (I have to fight tooth and nail. But I can't become an idol all by myself.)
    
    
        (In order to take everyone's hands and move forward, I must go the extra mile.)
        (I would be a burden to others if I don't. No... It's because I continue standing on the same stage with everyone.)
    
    
        (I can do it~ I'll stay after practice for a bit♪)
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Are there any naughty children here~? What a pity, there's only an average child☆
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        That scared me?! Woah, the Masked Pervert appeared!
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Ahaha. Tomoya-kun's reactions are amusing as usual. It has a rather shocked value to it, hehehe!
        How are you? You won't faint, correct?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I'm not that scared... What, wouldn't you typically shout "Are you surprised? You're surprised, aren't you! How amazing! ☆" with such glee?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Tomoya-kun really can't imitate me well...
        I am much more refined than that! My grace shines through even when I'm spouting nonsense, right?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Go look at a mirror.
        Uwah, on closer inspection, you're wearing some weird costume.
        You're not even participating in the Mystery Stage, so why are you dressed up as a phantom thief?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        No, I was thinking of adding something amazing into the mix if the whole unfolding felt boring.
        So I made a variety of arrangements, and I'm wearing one right now as a test.
        Though, looking at everything that has happened, it looks like my turn will never come.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah, I never thought you'd show up... Err, do you need something from me?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        No? I already said that I would stay behind the scenes. I'm here to clean up after the Mystery Stage is over because this auditorium will be used for class tomorrow.
        Cleaning it up everyday...
        And set everything back up before the show begins. It relies on physical strength more, so I couldn't ask Miss Anzu to come and help.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        So it's like that, how tiring... Would it be better if I came and helped out?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        No, no. I already feel like lecturing you for staying back to practice. It wouldn't be my problem if you push yourself too hard that you faint again.
        Please leave this kind of work to the backstage staff. You should go home immediately and get a good night's sleep to eliminate your fatigue.
        Living life in the fast lane won't do any good. I know you can't curb your enthusiasm, but being idle is part of our jobs as idols.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ...You saying such wise words[1] feels out of place.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        How painful. I always gave you advice in hopes of happy growth and even taught you with such care!
        Aaah! This unrequited love is a tragedy that would render even Shakespeare speechless with shock!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Uhm... You're always helping me improve, even if you are an absolute nutjob.
        But to be honest, I can't really keep up with your footsteps...
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Indeed. What is truly a pity is that you're not Wataru Hibiki. I have forgotten about that and regret it greatly.
        However, I shall forget about that in the blink of an eye tomorrow☆
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Please keep it in mind a bit longer. Seriously, you're always saying such careless things...
        I still want to practice some more. I don't want to get in your way, so is it fine if I dance here?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Sure. Don't mind me, do as you wish. However, if you mess anything up, I'll use a roundhouse kick to stop you.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Can you be a little more gentle? That roundhouse kick will kill someone. I'm still recovering, so please be careful with me~
    



    
    Wataru
    
        What a spoiled child you are.
        Well, don't fret about it. I might have ran into you by chance...
    
    
        But I won't get any closer, since I wouldn't want to hurt you again.
        I shall leave right after I've finished cleaning up, so please pretend I'm not here.
        I am quite inconsiderate and can only protect you by staying away.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Is that so? Then why did you watch today's show despite saying you'd "stay away" from me?
        You were sitting in Row D, Seat 23, right?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Oops, I've been found out. My disguise should have been perfect.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Too perfect that it's unnatural.
        The one most unlike you in today's audience was the guy sitting in Row D, Seat 23.
        He was at our S3 too...
    
    
        Speaking of which, that guy was always around. You've been watching over me the whole time, huh? I didn't expect you to worry that much.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Oh, oh... How embarrassing. This is Wataru Hibiki's greatest mistake.
        Thinking that someone as clueless Tomoya-kun would never see through my disguise, I slacked off, only to fail in the end.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Are you trying to piss me off?
    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ Localized from "先輩らしいこと" (senpai-like things). Wataru doesn't act like a "proper" senpai most of the time, which is why Tomoya felt off. The relationship between senpai and kouhai is quite important. Adding to that, kouhai usually talk to their senpai using honorific speech, but Tomoya often drops his formalities when talking to Wataru.

Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: AkiraCharacters: Izumi Sena, Kanata Shinkai, Nazuna Nito, Tomoya MashiroTL: MintTLC: AraQC: Ara, Ren, Tay





Season: SummerLocation: Seisou Hall Kitchen




Early September, Seisou Hall



    
    Kanata
    
        ...now, let's "talk" about "dinosaurs".
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Why dinosaurs...? We're in the middle of talking about how to split the Creature Clubs' budgets right now—don't change the subject!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        sadly, the "dinosaurs" have all gone "extinct".
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Okay then, so you basically don't intend to listen to a word I say.
    



    
    Kanata
    
        there was a dramatic "change" in the "environment", caused by a "meteorite" colliding into the earth.
    it's said that the "dinosaurs" all died out because they couldn't overcome that change.
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Oh, yeah~ I've heard of that. The meteorite made dust cover the entire sky, blocking out the sun and causing the Earth to freeze over.
    Since most dinosaurs were cold-blooded, they couldn't move around in the cold, so they couldn't hunt for food and eventually starved to death, right?
    But mammals were fine with the cold, because they had fur to keep them warm... or something like that.
    



    
    Kanata
    
        you're so knowledgeable, nazuna.
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Nah, I'm just saying what I remember off the top of my head.
    
  
        More importantly, I can't see where this discussion is going. What're you trying to say? What do dinosaurs have to do with how we split the dorm circles' budget?
    



    
    Kanata
    
        fufu. kids these days always want to jump to a "conclusion".
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        We're the same age, though~ Don't start talking like Rei-chin.
    
  
        If you're saying something weirdly cryptic to confuse me and make me agree with you, it's not gonna work.
    As the representative of Creature Club: Animals, I won't budge.
    Our circle's been put in charge of paying for the living expenses and food for the pets living in the dorms, after all.
    
  
    In fact, we could have all the money in the world and it still wouldn't be enough, y'know~ In contrast, you guys at Oceans don't need much money at all, right?
  



    
    Kanata
    
        whose money do you think is used to "purchase" the "fish" and other seafood we eat every day here at "seisou hall"?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Wait, you mean you guys were the ones purchasing the fish we eat at the dorms?
    



    
    Kanata
    
        no, the actual purchasing is done by "suppliers".
    but the "decision" of which "fish" to "buy" is left to us at "oceans".
    
  
        also, if we saw any decrease in our "budget allocation", it would become more difficult to buy more "tanks" for the dorms.
    if that happens, i would be in a worse "mood", and the "quality" of "fish" we purchase would drop. are you sure you want that?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        So it's a matter of your mood!? We're talking money right now!
    The Creature Clubs get their budgets from ES under the premise that it's used for things like the dorms' pet expenses.
    Don't go wasting it on vague stuff like putting yourself in a better mood or something.
    



    
    Kanata
    
        what i'm saying is that using all the "budget" on "land animals" is "unfair".
    "seisou hall" is very lacking in "moisture" right now, because none of the "budget" is given to us.
    
  
    "fish" have "existed" since ancient times long ago, and have survived that which killed the "dinosaurs"...
    they're the "great elders" of this planet. can't you show them some more "respect"?
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        I'm not looking down on fish or anything. But we don't need to go as far as cutting down on pet expenses, which are absolutely necessary, just to get more tanks to keep fish in.
    



    
    Kanata
    
  the "creature clubs" get a "lot more" money in their "budget" than necessary...
  so i'm asking if "oceans" can get even just a little bit more of it.
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        No means no! I can't give you guys what we don't have, and the current budget split is just fine!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        ehh~? that's unfair! that's favoritism! does having a "fur pelt" really make you so much more "important"?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Hmmm~? But we do need to save up extra money, just in case someone's pet gets sick or something...
    
  
        ...!?
    



    
    Kanata
    
        mn? what's the matter, nazuna?
      please don't make that "face". i got "worked up" and reacted a little too "harshly", okay? i'm sorry.
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        O-Oh, no, that's okay, I understand how you feel, Kanata-chin. But that's not—just, leave that for later and look! Look, over there!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        look at what...?
  


Location: Seisou Hall - First Floor Hallway





    
    Tomoya
    
        ......
  



    
    Izumi
    
        ......
  


Location: Seisou Hall Kitchen





    
    Kanata
    
        ...? that's someone from "oceans"—
  
  
        the lover of "shrimp", izumi.
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        Yeah, and our Tomo-chin is there too. What are they doing? They're walking so close to each other...
    



    
    Kanata
    
        yes, as if they're a "couple"~♪
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        Yeah, you're right—they're being kinda weird, huh!? C-Could it be that... that Izumi-chin isn't satisfied with just Mako-chin, and now he's subjecting Tomo-chin to his torment?

Season: SummerLocation: Florence, Italy




At the same time, in Florence



    
    Izumi
    
        And hey presto, illusion complete! Yay~! ♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ......
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Ha-ha-ha, just the thought of Nazunyan's face all panicked and freaked out is enough to make me laugh!
        Oh, that feels so good—that's what you get for treating someone like a straight up criminal♪
    
    
        I wonder if I should mess with him a little more. What if I sent him a message with something like, "If you want To-mo-ya-kun back, pay me a ransom fee..."
        ...Do you think he'd actually get the police involved if I did?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ......
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Hey now, To-mo-ya-kun, what's with that look on your face? Cheer up, won't you? We made a clean getaway from that hoard of zombies, and look, we're no longer handcuffed together. So why the long face...?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah... For some reason, Hibiki-senpai had it. The key, I mean.
        I'm telling you—that guy definitely stole the key and sneakily hid it away somewhere, then stood back to watch and laugh at our distress.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        But he also acted as a decoy for us to lure Nazunyan's hoard of zombies away from us, so what's the problem?
        Think of it as give-and-take. I'm not fan of how the saying goes but, as they say, "No man is an island~" ♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ugh~... But in the end, the two of us just danced along to the beat of Hibiki-senpai's script from start to finish. Doesn't that irritate you?
        All because I asked him to teach me some magic tricks...
        Which means he also taught me how to use him as a decoy and escape using misdirection.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Misdi...what?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Misdirection. It's when you draw attention to one thing, then in the meantime, you sneakily do a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes. It's one of the fundamentals of magic.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        So in this case, you used Hibiki in your misdirection, so you could successfully pull off the escape stunt?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yes. He should've just told me from the start!
        Instead, he went through all this trouble to make sure I was backed right up against the wall, so I had no choice but to go all out. He had me wrack my brains and waited for me to come up with this escape plan all by myself, while he stood back with a stupid grin on his face!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Ha-ha. When you explain something with words alone, there's no guarantee that you'll get the hang of it. You've got to think things through yourself, then repeat the process of trial and error until you get it right.
        We aren't geniuses that can hit the nail on the head from the start, after all♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You're in awfully high spirits, Sena-senpai. Are you really that happy about showing Nii~chan and the others who's boss?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Yeah. Besides, we're finally free from those wretched handcuffs. It's only natural that I can't keep this grin off of my face, isn't it?
        I think I've finally understood firsthand just how awful it is to have your freedom taken from you. I'm making a vow—I swear I'll never abduct anyone against their will ever again.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You don't really need to say that so proudly, though. Most people already know that sort of thing is unacceptable—you don't have to go through the trouble of putting it into words. It's kinda scary...
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Ha-ha. But even if I do scare you, you've got nowhere to escape to, have you, To-mo-ya-kun? This is my turf now—even if you go running to the police, you won't be able to do much because of the language barrier. Checkmate!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ugh, I can't believe the very first trip abroad in my life ended up like this... It's fine though, not like I had any immediate plans.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Exactly. The two of us have plenty of time to kill, so we might as well spend it productively, hmm? ♪
        I'll show you around. We've got some time to fritter away before Nazunyan and the others get wind of the situation and call off their "Idol Of The Dead" farce.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah. If we'd stayed in Japan, we'd just get chased by zombies forever. But well, there's no way those guys would go as far as chasing us overseas.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Right. These cuff marks alone are enough to stir up a fuss if anyone catches sight of them, but I don't know how I'd begin to explain bite marks from a zombie.
        This is a far more refined use of our time, at least until the excitement dies down over there♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I get it. But I seriously wasn't prepared to hop overseas at all, so all I've got with me are the clothes on my back. I've got to rely on you for everything else, Sena-senpai—a change of clothes, food, and accommodation. So uh, please don't take off without me.
    





    
    Izumi
    
        I know, I know. You let me stay in your room last night, so I'll at least return the favor there. That said, who knows what'll happen after that...?
        Let's take this bizarre episode and call it an experience, something we can learn to grow from, even by a little. Just like any ordinary creature that can be found anywhere else in the world.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Got it. Aha-ha. Just making it through life is an experience in itself...♪

    <content><![CDATA[Mayoi deserves lots of head pats. By the way, the second part feels surreal.
Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: Seitaro KinoCharacters: Anzu, Mayoi Ayase, Shinobu Sengoku, Wataru Hibiki, Tomoya MashiroTL: Kagehirin, RenTLC: HoliQC: haranami, Kagehirin, Ren, Sheep





Season: SummerLocation: Saison Avenue





    
    Mayoi
    
        ......
    
  
    Ah... I was so exhausted from crying that I ended up nodding off...
  
  
    The sun's already setting. The others are probably still incredibly busy at Dead End Café. Urgh, I feel so guilty...
        But... Even if I went back now, it's too late. I must live with this guilt clinging to me; that is the fate that has been imposed upon me.
  
  
    To think that I was driven into this much of a panic simply from encountering that innumerably large crowd of people...
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        I see, I see. I'd like to be briefed on aaaaall the details!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        C-Chief...? Why are you behind me!? Wait, why are you hiding behind that statue!?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Heh heh heh, do not tell me that you have forgotten...? I am a ninja! As such, it is a breeze to mask my presence within this large of a crowd♪
    
  
    Oof... Alright. Dashdashdash...♪
  
  
    I was searching for your whereabouts with Anzu-dono. However, you looked rather unwell, so I wanted to check on you.
  
    
        Anzu-dono, you are welcome to join us~♪ You do not have to conceal yourself anymore.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Urgh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! I made you go to such lengths for me...
        Abruptly shaking me awake—or, no, just leaving me to rot—would be a much more reasonable course of action!
        Please don't come so close to me! If you associate too heavily with me, my filth will rub off on you!
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hm~? I can't hear you~
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Aaah, please don't ignore what I'm saying! Stay, stay, Chief![1]
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hehe, you can't run from me~♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ah— Waah!?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Caught you♪
    You refer to yourself as "filthy," but I do not share that opinion, Mayoi-dono.
    Isn't it because you bear a pure, clean heart that you cannot accept yourself being anything less than perfect?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        N-No. That isn't true. I'm not the kind of person you believe I am. I'm an even lower, more irrelevant being—
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        I see. If you say so, Mayoi-dono, I'll leave it at that.
        But as I said before, this was a blunder on my end. Even though I was aware that being in the presence of others causes you great stress, I was unbelievably careless.
    
    
        You were starting to say so earlier, but it is because of that stress that you became unable to continue working, yes?
        You have a strong sense of responsibility. That is why you did not want to give onlookers the impression that the Ninja Association was responsible for causing any issues, correct?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Chief...
    Thank you so very much for not giving up on me, even though I'm so weak...
    
  
    B-But I... I just acted selfishly without speaking with you first! I'm incredibly sorry...!
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        There isn't any need to apologize. The issue also stemmed from my negligence as your supervisor, didn't it?
    
    
        Thus, I have a suggestion... How do you feel about taking charge of the cooking, Mayoi-dono?
    We ninjas are better suited for work in the shadows, aren't we? Anzu-dono will also check with the owner of the cafe regarding this suggestion♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Is that really alright...? For me to go back there after all this...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        You have no need for hesitation; everyone is awaiting your return.
        Nay, what I should be specifying is that no one bears any anger towards you from this event; not I, and not Anzu-dono, Hibiki-dono, or Mashiro-dono either.
    
    
        Now then, come with me, Mayoi-dono.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ...This wasn't a dead end at all.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
    A "dead end"? What do you mean by that?
    If there is a wall before you, you must simply scale it. That is what a ninja would do.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Chief, I love youuuuuu!
    



    
    Shinobu
    
    Whoa!? I-I can't move if you lean all your body weight on me!
    Anzu-dono, don't just laugh, please help me~!

        Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round! I shall now use my sentient hair to make art with white sauce! ♪
    
    
        One, two, amazing...☆
        Hehehe. The dead are also able to control their hair at will, you see! Next, I shall use it to serve your meals~☆
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        (Yeah, all of the customers' reactions were great... The mood's not bad at all.)
    
    
        (But he can't use theatrics to distract them from the slow service forever...)
        (It seems like everyone's hungry and such... They'd probably prefer character over looks.)
        (Hmm, it's been an hour since Sengoku and Anzu-san left. They should be coming back soon.)
    
    
        ...Huh, is the manager trying to get my attention from the kitchen?
        A thumbs up? Erm, now he's signing to me? So "phone"... An "OK," and "running"? Does this mean Sengoku and the others are coming back now?
    
    
        Alright. If so, I'll be relaying this to Hibiki-senpai with a signal...
    
    
        (Hibiki-senpai, I think they're coming back soon!)
        (Please hold out juuust a little bit longer!)
    



    
        Wataru
    
        (Haha. Could you be trying to say, "I really like you, Hibiki-senpai! You're so cool! I love you!"...?)
    
    
        (My, you're far too kind. Thank you, Tomoya-kun♪ Kiss...☆)
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        (Uhm, I think there's a big misunderstanding here?! What the hell was that weird signal I got back?)
    
    
        (Oh, whatever. This signal I sent can only mean one thing! The rest is up to you, Hibiki-senpai!)
    



    
    Wataru
    
        (Hehe. Fret not; I've received your message, Tomoya-kun.)
        (This is mere child's play when compared to the feats I had to accomplish in Mrs. Hidaka's grueling audition.)
    
    
        (I am a clown who shall fulfill the role expected of him—that's surely what everyone wishes to see from me, correct?)

Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: AkiraCharacters: Izumi Sena, Tomoya MashiroTL: AraTLC: MintQC: Mint, Ren, Tay





Season: SummerLocation: Drink Stand





    
    Izumi
    
        ......
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ...Sena-senpai? Were you even listening to me?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Huh? Oh, were you talking to me?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Who else would I be talking to? There's no one else here! Besides, weren't you the one who started the conversation~?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        But it's not like you and I are close enough to talk about things like this in the first place, To-mo-ya-kun.
        If you need an agony aunt to pour your heart out to, you should be going to Hibiki or Nazunyan.
        I happen to be extremely busy picking out a delicious beverage in order to appease even a smidgeon of my irritation.
    
    
        Idols can take any of these drinks for free, right?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh, yes. That sounds right. You can drink as much as you want free of charge, but as a result none of the drinks here are particularly good.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Yeah, I can see that, huh. Talk about cheaping out with the drink bar...
        Everything looks packed with sugar and atrocious for your health. So you're telling me there's not one drink here that's good for beauty?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. If that's the kind of drink you're after, you'd be better off heading to the café inside the main building.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Mm... But then I'd have to pay using L$, wouldn't I? If I were to do that, there would be a record that I've been loitering around here instead of heading back to Italy.
        That said, I feel like it would be a total waste to pay with yen.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha, Hajime said something similar before. That guy will do every conceivable thing he can think of to make something cheaper by even a single cent. If anything, I've got a lot of respect for that side of him.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Oh, Hajime Shino from Ra*bits... He's in the same unit as you, so you're close?
    
    
        I do envy you. Just about everyone in my unit can be ridiculously cheeky to me, would you believe?
        Especially lately, we've been butting heads a lot, and the atmosphere always feels prickly. I'm fairly jealous of Nazunyan's lot—everything seems to be so calm and peaceful all the time.
    
    
        Is there a knack to it? No, it could just simply be a matter of personalities...
        Unlike the brats in my unit, from what I can see, Hajime-kun and the others seem to be obedient, well-behaved kids, right?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        F-From the sound of things, you don't have any trouble remembering who Hajime is. Even though it seems like you completely forgot who I am.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        That kid's famous lately, isn't he? What with being marketed as a duo along with that prominent something-or-other from the same agency.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh, you mean Bishoujo-senpai... So that person is famous overseas too?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Not sure if I'd call them "famous"... More like, they stand out pretty noticeably, and not always in a good way. Rather like me. So you could say they left an impression on me.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh wow... For some reason, I'm kinda jealous.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Mn? Of what?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I was just thinking there's nothing about me that would stand out in such a way that I'd get people talking about me like that.
        When you're surrounded by colorful people while you're plain and average and ordinary, that can actually become a quirk in itself, I guess.
        But I really wish there was something unique about me, something that only I can bring to the table... I wish I had some sort of merit or skill to be praised for, or make others envious.
        When you say the name Tomoya Mashiro, you immediately think of this! Something like that that others could look up to and even try to imitate...
    
    
        It seems like my quirk is just being "ordinary," but it's not like anyone's out there like, "Man, I wish I was as ordinary as him!"
        Hajime, Mitsuru, and everyone else are evolving at an exponential rate and really making an impact, so I guess I'm sorta panicking and worrying about myself a whole lot.
    
    
        Our agency also seems to be at a loss for how to promote me...
        They took advantage of the rumor that I'm good at magic and asked me to do some magic tricks on some TV show.
        They figured that if I can pull off something impressive and things end up going well, that could become my thing.
        So like, even though it was all based on a big misunderstanding, I felt kinda flattered that they had high expectations for me.
    
    
        Besides, back when Nii~chan was about to make his official return to the group, I was kinda aggressive towards them and kicked up a bit of a fuss, so I don't really wanna go against our agency's wishes right now if I can help it—
        So I just went ahead and accepted the invitation to appear on that TV show without really thinking it through. And now I seriously regret it.
        There's no way I can master any seriously impressive magic in such a short amount of time.
    
    
        For the record, I did suck it up and beg Hibiki-senpai to give me some guidance. And I'm using whatever free time I have to practice as hard as I can, like I'm doing right now. But I just don't seem to be improving.
        I feel like I'm going needlessly out of my way, and I'm just wasting my own time—
    



    
    Izumi
    
        ......
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh, sorry! I've been rambling about something that has nothing to do with you, Sena-senpai.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        No, it's fine. It's one way for me to kill time.
        And precisely because it has nothing to do with me, I don't feel so much as an iota of stress listening to you go on. You're talking about a world a million miles away from me.
    
    
        Besides. I don't exactly dislike hard-working kids such as yourself.
        If anything, now I'm itching to lend a hand. Lately I haven't been able to lend any support to Yuu-kun nor Kasa-kun, so I'm kind of frustrated—
    
    
        I'm kind of warming to idea of becoming your kind-hearted, beloved "Onii~chan," To-mo-ya-kun...♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Y-You're not my big brother though, Sena-senpai!? Not under any circumstances!
        Ohhh god—the way you got all excited just now is giving me the same stench as the Masked Pervert!

Season: SummerLocation: Seisou Hall - First Floor Hallway




A few minutes later, Seisou Hallway



    
    Tomoya
    
        W-W-What are we gonna to do now, Sena-senpai!?
        This isn't how you said things would go! You swore that it'd be too early for anyone to see us!
        But now we've been caught red-handed! And by Nii~chan of all people!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Haaa!? Could you watch it with the "Nii~chan" so close to my ear? It's getting me weirdly excited!
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        What even!? Ugh, what is with this guy...!?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Oh, pipe down! Can you not start freaking out just because things didn't go exactly as planned? It's sooo annoying!
        It's not like I have psychic powers or something, okay? I'm not God!
        Besides, the important thing is being able to deal with it when everything doesn't go according to plan—well? Am I wrong!?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Urgh...! It's not that anything you're saying is wrong, it's just that—for some reason, it's hard to agree when you're the one saying it, Sena-senpai!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        And what the hell is that supposed to mean!? Why is it that not one person around here listens to a word I say? It's not every day you come across someone like me, who's practically always right about everything!
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        Just now! I heard a voice coming from over here...!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        yes! they were talking about something to do with "god". i do feel like this is a very "ominous" sign indeed... it could be just as you feared—
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        What's with that grim look on your face all of a sudden!? Do you have any idea why the two of them are acting so suspiciously?
    
    
        Nngh, even so... I'd really thought that scoundrel Izumi-chin—had calmed down a lot recently, so to speak!
    
    
        Could it be I just haven't heard anything about what he's been up to while I've been at college and he's been overseas!?
    
    
        Argh, what do I do? What do you do in a situation like this? Call the police!?
        What am I supposed to say? "Sir, I would like to report that my son has been kidnapped by a pervert"!?
    



    
    Kanata
    
        nooo, that would be making a far bigger "ordeal" out of this than necessary! we should prioritize confirming the "facts" and proceed with "prudence"!
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        Uh, proceed with what now? Y'know, sometimes I haven' godda glue what d' heg you're trynna say—not that I've got any right to talk!
    
    
        Well, whatever! If we wanna get to the bottom of this, we've gotta grab ahold of Izumi-chin and Tomo-chin!
        I'll go wake up a bunch of guys we can trust—once I let them know what's going on, they can help us out!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        alright! we shall make use of a "human wave attack" to track down izumi!
        of course, i'll help you out, nazuna. i can't turn back now; that "ship" has already set sail. in return, about our clubs' budgets—
  



    
    Nazuna
    
        We'll come back to that later! Temporary truce for now! All that matters to me at the moment, Kanata-chin, is rescuing Tomo-chin from Izumi-chin's evil clutches!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        alright! please set your mind at ease, nazuna! "justice" will always prevail in the end!
  



    
    Izumi
    
        Tch!? Urgh!? Grr!?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        *whisper* P-Please calm down, Sena-senpai! Otherwise they'll find us! And while we're at it, if you keep yanking me around like this, my wrist is going to be in so much pain!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        No—he—how could he!? Nazunyan, of all people—Nazunyan, of all people!
        There was absolutely no need for him to call me a—a pervert! He called me a pervert!? Has he always thought of me that way, all this time?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        N-Nii~chan just has a bit of a sharp tongue when he gets all riled up! If he says anything offensive, please just laugh it off!
        More importantly! We should focus on getting ourselves somewhere no one else is going to be around, before Nii~chan and the others spot us!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        That's exactly what I'm trying to do! Can you quit your whining? If you've got somewhere to go, then go! Go on, shoo!
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        But I can't—that's what I've been trying to tell you! You're just like Nii~chan—getting all riled up and completely forgetting your surroundings!
        Pleeease try to remember: you and I are acting as one right now! If one of us goes somewhere, the other has to go too! There's no way around it!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        I know. Why are you telling me something I am already aware of. Oh, you think I'm some kind of idiot, do you!?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Aargh, this guy is impossible! He keeps twisting my words and assumes the worst!
        I've never been around an upperclassman that acted like this before, so I have no idea what to do! Not like I don't have others who are troublesome in a different way to deal with though!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        What's this about!? Who am I a disappointment to in comparison?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        N-Nobody said anything like that!?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        That's what it sounded like to me! I knew it, you think I'm some dumbass who can't even tell when he's being insulted, don't you!? I can tell from the way you treat me!
  
    
        Argh, I've had it! This is sooo ridiculous! Why do I have to be handcuffed to some annoying kid I barely know!?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ow, ow, ow!? The handcuffs are chafing my wrist! Will you please just calm down, Sena-senpai? No matter how much of a fuss you make, it's not going to get us anywhere!

Season: SummerLocation: Ensemble Square - Emergency Stairs




We return to the day of The Abduction Of Tomoya Mashiro ft. Izumi Sena



    
    Tomoya
    
        After that, for some reason, you ended up lending me a hand, Sena-senpai.
        You stood in as a member of the audience, and I practiced some magic in front of you.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Yeah. That's one of the fundamentals of any craft, be it magic, idol work, modeling, or whatever else.
        When you hole yourself up and practice something alone, you develop bad habits—which ends up rendering all the time you spent not just pointless, but outright harmful.
    
    
        When it comes to improving, what you need is someone to scrutinize and evaluate your performance, and then offer you the guidance to proceed in the right direction.
        I just happened to have slightly more free time than I know what to do with, and I have excellent taste no matter the field, so I was perfect for the job! ♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ughh... You sounded so sure of yourself and weirdly confident that I just took you at your word, without so much as a second thought.
        I was even about to completely reevaluate my opinion of you. Like, "Wow, maybe Sena-senpai's actually pretty kind~♪"
    



    
    Izumi
    
        What do you mean "maybe"? I'm always kind, aren't I? Did you forget all those times I had your back last year!?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        No, uh. This is kind of hard to say but, basically all you did was criticize me, Sena-senpai. I don't remember you giving me any real guidance or support.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Excuse me? Criticism is essential, isn't it? Back when I was studying ballet, my instructor would constantly lambast me to the point that it was dehumanizing!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh... So that experience shaped who you are today, Sena-senpai...
        I'm totally fine with being treated like trash, but I think you should be kinder to the rest of your juniors.
        Positive encouragement seems to be the best motivation to grow as a person.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        But look here: to put it bluntly, I didn't have a single thing to praise you for, To-mo-ya-kun. You're obviously a novice at magic, and every single move you made was just stiff and awkward and clumsy.
        I'm no magician, but I could still tell you were crap. You made it pretty obvious how all of your tricks were done. It was just painful to watch, don't you agree?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ugh... It sounds like I'm just making excuses, but I swear I was way better when I was practicing by myself!
        But the way you kept staring at me with that piercing gaze made me weirdly nervous—
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Hmm? Well, I do happen to be incredibly beautiful, but there's nothing I can do about that♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        It was more like, I was terrified that you'd start scolding me no matter what I did.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        I don't particularly intend to scold you. For the most part, I have nothing but support for hard-working kids.
        Giving you straightforward critiques was simply me doing everything in my power to help you out—wouldn't you see that as an expression of my kindness?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        But you didn't just stop at critiques alone, you'd want to physically get involved too...
        When I was practicing that escape stunt, you insisted that I "let you try, just this once."
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Well, it looked easy enough to me.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        No, it's super difficult! I'm using real handcuffs for this escape stunt, like the ones the police use!
        The whole point of the trick is to escape from something unescapable! That's what makes people go "Whoa!" or "Amazing!"
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Well, I suppose... If handcuffs were easy to escape from, the police wouldn't always be using them to apprehend criminals, huh.
        But still. They just looked like a pair of cheap and flimsy toys. On the off chance something went wrong, I figured it would be easy to bust out of them.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Excuse this, excuse that... What are you, a little kid?
    
    
        Oh god, I'm so sorry for being so cheeky to you, Sena-senpai!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        No, it's fine. A touch of rebelliousness is cute. You're the child of someone who "has a sharp tongue when he gets all riled up," aren't you, To-mo-ya-kun?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ughh... Sorry, I guess I'm also kinda losing it, thanks to this bizarre situation.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Yeah. Who would have thought amidst the chaos of trying to get the handcuffs off we'd end up like this?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah. On top of the two of us being handcuffed together—
    



    
    Izumi
    
        —We can't get the handcuffs off, either. But why? Didn't you have a key ready? Isn't it normal to have a key ready?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I've told you over and over again, we were so flustered trying to get the handcuffs off that I guess I lost the key in the scuffle.
        So I think I might've dropped it in the same place I was practicing magic yesterday.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Worst case scenario, one of the cleaning staff handed it in. But are you certain that was really when you lost the key?
        We searched all over that room yesterday until late at night, but couldn't find it anywhere.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Right, I know... That's what makes it such a mystery. I know I had a key ready, but it just disappeared.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Well, it didn't just disappear. You definitely just dropped it somewhere, or put it away in your pocket and forgot about it, I'm telling you.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        That's what I believe too, and yet... While we were retracing our steps god knows how many times yesterday, we ended up running out of time.
        We were making such a fuss that the security guards and other staff in the building came over to investigate...
        Then you insisted that you "couldn't be seen like this!" and started dragging me away to flee the scene.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Well, I didn't have a choice in the matter. I've already said this before, but I do not want the rest of Knights to know that I've been staying out here instead of flying back to Italy.
        Not to mention, if they saw me handcuffed to a cute younger boy, there'd probably be a big misunderstanding that I'm up to some funny business like kidnapping all over again.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        It actually did seem like Nii~chan had that kind of misunderstanding when he saw us. Though I'm sure he'll understand if we explain the situation to him.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        No, no! When blood rushes to Nazunyan's head, he won't listen to a word from anyone around him! And I have my doubts whether Shinkai is capable of a sensible conversation in the first place.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Not that it matters, but why were those two together anyways? They're a pretty unusual pair.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Don't know, don't care. Never mind what anyone else is up to—all that matters right now is sorting ourselves out, right?

Season: SummerLocation: Ensemble Square - Emergency Stairs





    
    Izumi
    
        Anyway, we've gotta do something about this situation ASAP. Before anyone sees us and causes a commotion, if possible.
        It's about time for everyone to get here, too, so we'd better hurry... Though last night we did manage to hide ourselves in your dorm room, since it was empty for some reason.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah... My roommate, Ayase-senpai, hardly shows up at all for some reason. I sometimes feel his presence from inside the ceiling, though.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        I don't know this Ayase person, but you're saying there's another weirdo here now? What is this place, a weirdo factory?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ayase-senpai says and does weird things sometimes, but he's a good person. Probably.
        Anyway, let's focus on getting out of these handcuffs as quickly as possible. At this rate, it'll get in the way of our daily lives.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        I've learned that the hard way. Not getting to use one of my hands is already enough of a pain, and neither of us wants to be stuck together until the day we die, right?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah. You keep complaining whenever I try to do anything too, and it feels like I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown any second now...
    
    
        Uh, or rather, you wouldn't be able to go back to Italy still handcuffed to me.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Yeah, I doubt they'd let me through airport security looking like this.
    
    
        We'll just have to do something about this before anyone finds us. Where were you practicing your magic trick? We should try looking there first.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Before that, I wanna get some food... I've skipped a few meals since yesterday because of this whole situation, so I'm starving.
        Maybe I should've brought some snacks from my dorm room...
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Haha. Boys your age sure have to eat a lot, don't they, To-mo-ya-kun? Maybe it's because we're practically attached to each other right now, but I can hear your tummy rumbling♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        What? My tummy wasn't rumbling, though?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Aww, come on, there's no need to be shy. Didn't we take a bath together last night? We're practically besties♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I-It's not like I had a choice, and I tried my best not to look in your direction—
    
    
        Wait, huh? I just heard a noise that sounded like a hungry stomach, too. Was that you, Sena-senpai?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Excuse me? As if I would ever make such an unflattering noise in public!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Speaking of unflattering, how are we gonna use the toilet like this...? We barely managed to take a bath, but it'd be impossible to avoid things when using the toilet, right?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Don't think of that right now! As long as we somehow get out of these handcuffs before we can't take it anymore, we won't have to worry about that, okay? I'm saying we should take action before that! Don't you understand!?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ughh, why do you get all snappy so quickly? The way you're saying it makes it sound like all of this is my fault~!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        And it's true! If you hadn't practiced that magic trick where I could see you, none of this would—
    



    
    Subaru
    
        Uuuurrrggghhh!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Gyyaaaaaaagh!?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha, didn't you just say you wouldn't make unflattering noises, Sena-senpai?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        I-I-I couldn't help it, okay!? Hey you, you orange mop! What's with you all of a sudden? Don't scare us like that!
    



    
    Subaru
    
        Uuurrghh, urrraaaghh—
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Wh-What is that? Some sort of impression? I get that you're the one who's been making weird noises all this time, but...?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        (...Oops, better hide the handcuffs before he sees them.)
    
    
        (Ughh. Hiding the handcuffs like this makes me feel like I'm on TV with the subtitles saying, "The culprit is finally being arrested!" or something...)
        (Just what crime did we commit to get ourselves in this mess?)
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Wh—To-mo-ya-kun! Don't just stand there daydreaming, do something about this orange mop! Ra*bits and Trickstar are friends and stuff, right!?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ......?
    



    
    Subaru
    
        Urrraaagh♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Eeek!? Wh-Why are you clinging on to me, Akehoshi-senpai!? Stop, Hokuto-senpai and Hajime'll get mad at me...!
    



    
    Koga
    
        Grraaaaarrrghh!
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Raaaaaaughh~ as they say♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Huh? What? Oogami-senpai and Sengoku—wh-what's going on? Why are you coming towards us while making weird noises!?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        It looks like they're not the only ones being weird, though...?
    



    
    Kaoru
    
        Bleeeaaagh, raaarrgh.
    



    
    Souma
    
        Uh, ungghh? Uhhhhgghh—
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Eep, there's people acting weirdly coming from downstairs, too!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Yep, and even people like Kao-kun[1] who wouldn't usually join in on annoying pranks like this are here... H-Hang on, this is so weird that it's actually starting to creep me out...
    



    
    Subaru
    
        Urrrrghh—
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Eeep!? Th-This guy just tried to bite me! Stop it, Akehoshi-senpai, I thought you were nice!?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        "Ding dong ding dong♪"
    



    
    Izumi
    
        ......?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        "This is a public service announcement. There is currently a special event being held in the ES Building—Idol of the Dead."
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Mmn? Idol of the what now? That's Nazunyan's voice, isn't it?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah, it is. It's been a while, getting to hear Nii~chan's voice over the speakers like this...♪
    



    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ In the original text, Izumi calls Kaoru "Hakaze," but since this story occurs after the ! era story Dance on Ice, he should now call him "Kao-kun." The name has been edited for consistency.

Some minutes later



    
    Nazuna
    
        Fufufu♪ Now Izumi-chin's as good as a rat in the bag!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        yes! it'll be as easy as cheezumi~[1]
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Yeah? Uh... Yeah, I guess?
    



    
    Kanata
    
        fufufu. looks like "oceans" scored the "first goal".
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        That's not in the rules! We're not having a pun competition~!
    
    
        Idol of the Dead is a full-scale war between Animals and Oceans!
        Whichever side wins gets to decide how to split the next Creature Club budget!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        that's right. it was "unproductive" to "argue" about it endlessly, after all~
        the more time we "waste" arguing, the longer the creatures go "hungry".
    
    
        that's why we're going to decide this with a one-off "competition".
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        The rules are simple! Whoever catches Izumi-chin first, wins!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        yes, so we're basically playing a game of "tag"~♪
        although it feels more like an "activity" for the "asobi club" rather than the "creature club", doesn't it?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        That's fine! We'll deal with this while everyone thinks we're just playing a game! That's why I went and got permission from ES management to make that broadcast just now!
        "An unprecedented zombie hazard has broken out in the ES building...!"
        "Can the sole survivors, Tomoya Mashiro and Izumi Sena, successfully escape from the approaching zombie horde!?"
    
    
        —That's the setting we're going with for this elaborate game of tag! We'll film it, edit it, and stream it online or something!
        That's "Idol of the Dead"! This way, no one will think we're being weird even if we make a big scene chasing them!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        mhm. it's in the "building" and not "seisou hall", after all. there are people working as usual here, too, so we needed an "excuse".
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Yeah. We're gonna settle this privately before the cops show up to investigate~ After all, we still don't know if Izumi-chin's really committed a crime.
    



    
    Kanata
    
        but, why "zombies"? our "circles" were formed to take care of "living creatures", so aren't they the "complete opposite" of what the "creature clubs" are for?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        It's just 'cause I watched a movie like that last night. It's not like I could've come up with a great idea like this at such short notice, y'know~...?
        Besides, do you know why zombies attack humans, Kanata-chin?
    



    
    Kanata
    
        huh? isn't it because they're hungry?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Nope! Zombies don't seem to die naturally from starvation, but they still target humans relentlessly! Why's that?
        It's because they're jealous of the living! They have a maddening desire to extend their own lives!
        Zombies' obsession with the concept of living corresponds exactly to what the Creature Clubs stand for! You think so too, don't you Kanata-chin...!?
    



    
    Kanata
    
        nazuna, you haven't "slept" much, have you? you're acting strangely. and you say you watched a scary "movie", huh...?
        if that's the case, then it's "reasonable" that you couldn't sleep. could it be that you're being extra aggressive today because you didn't get enough "sleep" and don't have "room to breathe"? ♪
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Well, that too, but I just couldn't stop worrying about Tomo-chin~! Hang in there Tomo-chin, I'm gonna use every last ounce of strength I possibly can to getcha oudda dere~!
    


Location: Ensemble Square - Hallway





    
    Subaru
    
        Urrrrrgh♪ Raaaargh☆
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Dammit! I thought Yumenosaki was bad, but ES is just as insane!
        When I was looking on from a distance, I thought, "Huh, looks like they're working pretty seriously lately, aren't they?"
    
    
        But this is what it actually looks like! Just because the wrapping paper's changed doesn't mean what's inside the box is any different, huh! These idols are just as unhinged as I remember them!
        Every single one of you are sooo annoying~!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ow ow ow, I told you not to yank on me like that! You're gonna rip my wrist off!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        ...If I rip To-mo-ya-kun's wrist off, I'll get the chance to escape on my own, huh?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Wait, don't say that, that's scary! You're joking, right!?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        O-Of course I am. The announcement said something about zombies and stuff, but it's not as bad as an actual disaster film scenario.
        The zombies chasing us are just the usual crew, and you can tell they're definitely not rotting or anything. We can't waste our time actually being scared of them, got it?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        That's true... They keep saying "urrrgh" and try to bite us, though, so it's still a bit creepy. They can't even hold a conversation.
        But even if they did manage to bite us, we wouldn't get infected.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Infected...?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        In zombie movies, people who get bit by zombies get infected by a virus or something and turn into zombies themselves. That's how zombies multiply.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        What th— That's so gross... That's a no from me, I'm not interested in becoming an ugly rotting corpse, you hear? If I'm gonna die, I want to die pretty!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. I don't think it'll actually escalate to become life-threatening, though. The zombies don't seem to listen to anything we say to them—
    
    
        And we don't wanna get bitten, either, so let's just look out for incoming zombies, and look for the key at the same time.
    
    
        That'll solve all our problems. After we escape, we can explain to everyone what happened, and go back to our ordinary lives.

Season: SummerLocation: Drink Stand




Turning back time, the day before The Abduction Of Tomoya Mashiro ft. Izumi Sena



    
    Izumi
    
        (Argh, why is it so damn hot!? It's so freaking clammy and humid that I feel like I've stepped right into hell! This sucks!)
        (This is exactly why I hate this country! I knew that escaping overseas was the right idea! There may be a whole crowd making fun of me now, but they'll all see the value in my decision once we reach the afterlife for sure!)
    
    
        (I can already see them—ten or twenty years from now, even Kasa-kun and Naru-kun are going to come crawling back to me with their heads bowed low. "I was wrong!" they'll grovel—mark my words!)
        (Even though right now they—along with our fans—can't wrap their heads around why I took off overseas so suddenly!)
        (That was part of my plan all along! As if I'd turn around now and put a dent in my perfectly constructed future plans!)
        (Whoever came up with the idea of constructing this stupid building without bothering to give me a heads up is in the wrong here!)
    
    
        (It's all their fault! And now they're all "You guys need to get a clue!" to people like me and Nazunyan, who've already thought about which path to take—as we should!—and made our preparations—mn?)
        (What's this? Some colorful hoops just rolled over and landed by my feet? Is there some kind of paranormal activity going on here...?)
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh god, sorry about that! Those are mine!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Mn? And who are you? Uh—right, you're one of the kids from Nazunyan's unit, aren't you?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Wait, you don't remember who I am?
    
    
        Even though we've performed together multiple times? It's me, Tomoya Mashiro from Ra*bits! Thanks for always having our back!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        I don't remember...not doing anything for you, I suppose.
    
    
        That's right, I looked after you during Mystery Stage and the school festival, didn't I? Even though it's not as if I have hours of free time to waste!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Uh? Huh? Why are you in such a bad mood? Did I say something that rubbed you the wrong way?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        No, it's not your fault, uh... To-mo-ya-kun. I'm in a bad mood because of the ridiculous Grossness Index of this country!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh yeah, it's been crazy hot lately.
        And to make matters worse, since the ES building wants to show everyone they're doing their part in energy conservation, they've turned off the AC anywhere it's unnecessary.
    
    
        There aren't normally a lot of people around this area, so it's boiling hot and you get all sweaty just from walking around.
        In order to avoid heatstroke, you've gotta drink plenty of water.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        ......
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ...? W-What is it? Is there something on my face?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        No, I was just thinking everything out of your mouth is so mind-numbingly ordinary... You're saying meaningless stuff I already know, and I've already forgotten what you've said despite standing right next to you.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Don't call me ordinary!
    
    
        Wait, I mean—it's kinda like a trigger word for me, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't use it—it sort of sets me off!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Excuse me? Why is some small-fry who'll start wailing to the extent he'll get "set off" lecturing me about my behavior? Could you not? Who do you think you are?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I'd love to ask you the same thing... Are you royalty or an aristocrat or something, Sena-senpai?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Hmph. For the record, knights can also be considered nobility or a privileged class depending on the country and time period, you know~?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        A knight... Well, I guess you are part of Knights, Sena-senpai. You've got a point...
    
    
        Um, are you here in Japan because you've got some Knights-related work?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        That's right. Up until yesterday we had a live tour kinda thing, and a week from now we've got to do a bunch of promotional stuff related to that, so I've heard.
        And so, in the meantime I've got the week off.
    
    
        Going to and fro between countries is a pain in the ass, and the time difference throws off my circadian rhythm, which is so bad for my skin...
        These days whenever I've got time off, I've just been staying out here instead of heading back to Florence.
    
    
        Not like I've got much work back in Florence anyway. But I can't let the other members of Knights know that, it's embarrass—or rather—I feel like they might make a dumb joke out of it.
        So I only pretend to head back to Florence and just keep myself to places I won't run into anyone I know as much as possible. I normally crash at Leo-kun's folks' place.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Leo-kun... You mean, Tsukinaga-senpai? Aren't the two of you close though? Is it okay for him to know about your weird behavior?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        That guy listens to whatever I say, so if I tell him to keep something to himself, he won't breathe a word to anyone else.
        Besides, nothing about the image he has of me is even worth preserving... not anymore.
    
    
        Anyway. Hey now, are you sure it's alright for you to be chit-chatting with me like this, To-mo-ya-kun?
        Ra*bits seem to be fairly popular, so shouldn't you be relatively busy right now?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh... It's the same as before for us, "no rest for the weary!"
        In order to gain some recognition from our agency, Rhythm Link, which has a long history, we've gotta push ourselves as hard as we can to see some results.
        So recently we've been crazy busy taking on both solo and unit work whenever we can.
    
    
        Even though I don't have any great talents or anything, I've still gotta try my best at everything I can.
        It's so stressful! The project I'm wrapped up in at the moment feels like a train wreck already!
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Mn? What do you mean?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Well, um. It seems as though Hibiki-senpai's introduced me on some TV show as his "number one apprentice." But the TV show in question actually turned out to be one that features magic.
        So now there's this big misunderstanding that I can do magic tricks just as well as him.
    
    
        I can't, though! It's true that he's been teaching me a lot, but about acting, not magic.
        Besides, I don't want to be seen as that guy's "apprentice," I want to be seen as his equal, his rival...
        Even though considering my current abilities, or lack thereof, that probably sounds like a load of nonsense.

Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: AkiraCharacters: Izumi Sena, Tomoya MashiroTL: MintTLC: AraQC: Ren, Spoon





Season: SummerLocation: Ensemble Square - Hallway





    
    Izumi
    
        ......
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ...? What's wrong, Sena-senpai? Are you gonna say that I'm "mind-numbingly ordinary" again?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Mn~... Actually, I was thinking that your ability to act so ordinarily in this ridiculously extreme situation is a talent on its own.
        I've been spending all this time running around like a headless chicken, but you somehow seem to be getting calmer and calmer. I just thought that was pretty impressive, that's all.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I'm just used to the extraordinary. Rather, ever since I entered Yumenosaki, everything that happens around me has been ridiculous and strange.
        Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd experience all of this!
        So, somehow, I feel like today's just like any other day.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        I see. But still, being able to stay sane as if it's "just any other day," no matter how drastically your surroundings change—I think that's a pretty valuable skill. Someone like you could be really strong in this industry, y'know?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Th-Thanks. But if I'm not interesting enough just by being my ordinary self, I don't think I'll be very popular as an idol—
        So I wanted some kind of redeeming feature or special talent that I could show off.
        That's why I've been practicing magic tricks so hard. I thought that could be what makes me unique, just like what the public and our agency are saying.
    
    
        Well, that didn't work out as well as I'd hoped, and I couldn't do anything better than just "average," no matter how hard I tried.
        And because of that, I messed up, and I even caused you all this trouble—
    



    
    Izumi
    
        ......
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh, sorry. I started rambling again.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Like I said, I don't mind. It passes the time, anyway.
        Besides, I think we're having a much more meaningful day than someone pretending to be a zombie and wandering all over the place for no good reason, aren't we?
    
    
        So as thanks for spending some quality time with me, let me give you some advice as your senior.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Advice, and not criticism?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Not criticism. ...I think I've had the same worries as you in the past, To-mo-ya-kun.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You, of all people, Sena-senpai?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Yeah.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You, who's always so confident it gets on people's nerves?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Why'd you rephrase it like that? Do you want to make me angry?
    
    
        Anyway, when I first entered Yumenosaki, my modeling career was starting to plateau...
        My juniors were getting better and taking jobs that could've been mine, and I didn't have my own place in the industry.
        So I decided to use Yumenosaki as a new playing ground to develop my other talents.
    
    
        But I turned out to not be that great at idol stuff. In the beginning, I could barely even handle the basics like singing and dancing.
        When I stopped to look at the people around me, I found myself surrounded by more geniuses than I could count, all in a totally different league from me. I would compare myself to them, and I'd feel completely discouraged.
        Thinking back, that was pretty stupid. They're them, and I'm me.
    
    
        But look at me now. That pathetic loser managed to become so successful, he can act all high-and-mighty as a member of Knights, one of ES's Big Three. Can you guess why?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Huh? Isn't it because you found out you were talented after all?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        I dunno about that... But, talented or not, there's always a road to success. In my case, I grabbed a nearby genius and used him as my weapon.
        I used that weapon to strike down everyone else, and conquered the summit. But my weapon broke as a result of me using it so carelessly.
        I probably made a big mistake there. But either way, I succeeded. I got the results and the praise I've always wanted, and I regained my sense of self-worth.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ......
    



    
    Izumi
    
        You should just do the same, To-mo-ya-kun.
        Though you shouldn't be reckless like me and hurt the people around you while doing so. Even if you're a normal, average person, you should still be able to succeed.
        After all, we're not alone in our battles.
    
    
        Thanks to the annoying-ass unit system being the mainstream, we'll have to group up with someone else whether we like it or not.
        Leave the difficult stuff you can't do to someone else. It's nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of.
        You don't have to do everything on your own.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ......
    



    
    Izumi
    
        If only the younger me could've noticed that sooner.
        If only I could've thought of him as a teammate to fight along with side by side, instead of seeing him as a weapon that could only do whatever I told him to—
        Maybe he wouldn't have had to suffer on his own and break under it all.
    
    
        ...Ah, sorry. You have no idea what I'm going on about, huh. This is sooo embarrassing.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Nah. I'll use your words right back at you—I don't mind. Besides, it'd be unfair if I made you listen to my worries and not let you do the same.
        We're connected like this now, so I'll help you carry whatever you've got on your shoulders.
        I don't wanna become an extra piece of baggage for you, and it's easier for two people to carry it than just one, right?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Hmm? I don't really get what you're trying to say, but you're being pretty cheeky~♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Didn't you say that "a touch of rebelliousness is cute"?
        Besides. This rare piece of advice you gave me could come in handy.
    
    
        You're right—we're not doing this alone, and we can leave the things we can't do to others who can.
        Of course, it'd be rude to make someone else always do all the work. That would break them, like you said. But yeah, I guess I can depend on others every once in a while.
    



    
    Izumi
    
        ......?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Sena-senpai, I've just thought of a plan. Could you help me out?
    



    
    Izumi
    
        Haa? I'm not exactly in any position to not help you, am I?

Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: AkiraCharacters: Kanata Shinkai, Nazuna Nito, Wataru HibikiTL: Mint, RenTLC: AraQC: Ara, Ren, Spoon





Season: SummerLocation: Ensemble Square - Hallway




That evening



    
    Nazuna
    
        We've got you now, Izumi-chin! Now put 'em up! You're under arrest!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        we went through a lot of trouble, didn't we~ it's already "evening", and this story turned out to be as long as an "epic".
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Ugh, and thanks to him, we're becoming the hot topic on HoldHands and other social media.
        They're saying stuff like "The Creature Club guys are up to something stupid..." And more and more spectators are coming to see what the fuss is all about.
    



    
    Kanata
    
        fufu. they've given us "donations" in the form of "admission fees" too. should we add them to the "budget" of the "creature clubs"?
        if we do so, then we can "solve" our "problems" without having to fight or hurt each other over it♪
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        I guess that's a pretty idol-like way to do it~ Putting on a show and getting tips in a hat.[1]
        It was only supposed to be a cover-up, but maybe we actually should stream Idol of the Dead and enable donations or something, huh?
    



    
    Kanata
    
        let's think of that after we "solve" everything. all "creatures" that aren't "human" tend to not think so much about the "future".
        but even so, they live their lives to the "fullest".
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        We're coming in! Give it up, Izumi-chin! We already know you're in this room~!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        aah, that's cheating! you went first just when i was saying something "deep"!?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        It's your fault for letting you guard down! We're still in the middle of a competition, y'know~! We at Animals are gonna be the ones to catch Izumi-chin and get a bigger cut of the Creature Club budget!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        not if i can help it~! Heroes never lose!
    


Location: Prop Room





    
    Nazuna
    
        Grrragh! Come out, Izumi-chin! You'll pay for the crime of putting your hands on my Tomo-chin with your life!
    



    
    Kanata
    
        w-we won't kill him, right? we're only going to catch him, right?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Amazing! Greetings, my beloved compatriots of the Creature Clubs!
        I am neither fin nor fur,[2] but as we are all creatures of the same world, I shall entertain each and every one of you amicably in our time here together!
    
    
        Now, allow me to give a proper welcome! Would you like dinner? A bath? Or would you like...me?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        ......
    



    
    Kanata
    
        wataru.
        wait, what are you doing here? what kind of "prank" is this?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehehe. But—for the record—I too happen to be a member of Animals, so it's not inconceivable for me to be here, wouldn't you agree?
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Yeah, I guess, but... Huh? I swear I heard their voices coming from here—but they're nowhere to be seen? Wait, does that mean the voices I heard were from you, Wataru-chin?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Correct. I just happened to receive a humble request from Tomoya-kun as to whether I could use my mimicry abilities to impersonate them.
        With that, I was able to buy them as much time as possible.
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        But why would you do that...?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Because he asked me to. As if I could ever say no to those adorable puppy-dog eyes he begged me with~♪
        Besides, it's quite rare for Tomoya-kun to ask me for help, so I was over the moon...♪
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Ack, so we came all the way here for nothing! We've been tricked!
    
    
        But if Tomo-chin was the one who asked Wataru-chin for the favor, does that mean he doesn't want to get caught either...?
        Why? Could it be that Izumi-chin didn't actually abduct Tomo-chin against his will?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        That's about right. And yet you jumped to conclusions and kicked up a massive fuss, creating a far bigger deal out of this than necessary...
        I see you're just as easily flustered as ever, Mister Rabbit.
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        Huh~? But I'm just so worried about Tomo-chin~!
    



    
    Wataru
    
        I'm sure you are. It's wonderful to hear that you're taking such excellent care of Tomoya-kun, who I entrusted to you.
    
    
        Though, I wonder if you're too overprotective. But perhaps that's because I tend to favor a harsher training regime that packs a punch so hard it leaves a dent.
        Though one could say that it strikes a fine balance with your tendency to be a bit too soft on your juniors.
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        What are you talking about? More importantly, you seem to be on Tomo-chin's side, since you accepted his request—so where are they now?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Now? Well, you know what they say: a magician never reveals his secrets. So I'm afraid I cannot tell you.
    



    
    Nazuna
    
        A magician...?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Correct. After all, Tomoya-kun does well when it counts. Or rather, he can do anything he sets his mind to.
        He remained calm through this bizarre situation, came up with the best plan he could think of, and pulled off the most magnificent "escape stunt."
    
    
        Amazing! Pressure makes diamonds, after all!
        Being mean to him and having my dove hide the key was worth it♪
    



    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ In the original text, Nazuna calls the donations "ohineri" (おひねり). Ohineri refers to the tips actors receive in taishu engeki (大衆演劇, lit. "theater for the masses," a genre of Japanese theater), and its name is based on how these tips were originally presented to the actors by wrapping money in a piece of paper, twisting it into a knot, and tossing it on stage during the show. Nowadays, ohineri is usually given by clipping bills or envelopes of money to the actors' clothes, or by handing it to them directly after the show.
    
    
        ↑ Literally "neither of the land nor the sea" (陸のものとも海のものともつかない). It's modified from a proverb meaning "neither fish nor fowl"—hard to predict.

Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: AkiraCharacters: Anzu, Tomoya MashiroTLC: convex#3440QCs: Meru, Sheep





Season: SpringLocation: Dance Studio






    
    Tomoya
    
        "Come now, everyone! Take a look and laugh!"
        "I am a clown who seeks to spread laughter through silly antics!"
        "Feel free to spit and throw rocks at me to cast away your daily sorrows! ♪"
    
    
        (Ugh... That came out differently than I'd expected.)
    
    
        (What am I doing wrong? I can't get into my role!)
        (They told me that it would be a bit more challenging this time, but I should've learned some techniques from last year...)
    
    
        (I stumble the moment I step out of my comfort zone. What am I supposed to do? I wish I was better at applying my skills into new roles—)
    
    
        Eek!
    
    
        Ah, you scared me! D-Do you need something, Producer? Man, with all that clapping out of nowhere, I thought you were a ghost!
    
    
        You sure have a quiet presence... Oh, hold on. Is my time in the dance studio up?
        So you're here to tell me to leave?
    
    
        I'm sorry! I was actually practicing with everyone else in Ra*bits, but Hajime and Mitsuru had to do work of their own. That's why I'm here alone.
        There was some time left in the booking, so I thought I might as well do some rehearsal by myself!
        I couldn't practice my part for Ra*bits since I wanted the others to keep pace.
    
    
        Shit, I was so caught up in rehearsing that I lost track of time! I'll pack up and leave right away—
    
    
        Woah?!
    
    
        Ahaha. Guess I tripped...♪
    
    
        You were laughing just now huh, Producer? Oh no, I'm not saying that was rude.
        That laugh! That's the exact reaction I wanted out of my audience! Um, could you tell me what was so funny about what I just did?
    
    
        Oh, I'm being too pushy? Sorry, I was in a rush...
    
    
        You see, I'm starting to get some real acting jobs. The role I got cast for this time is a bit challenging...
    
    
        Sigh, this all started because I've been in the Drama Club for quite a while. During one of the performances I was in, someone took notice and scouted me.
        That gave me an opportunity to be in movies and theatricals, though they were all supporting roles.
    
    
        It's quite rare for someone to act well despite looking like a child nowadays.
        I've been taking advantage of this feature of mine here and there.
        When people think of child actors, they think of me, Tomoya Mashiro! ...That's the kind of reputation I have at this point, more or less.
    
    
        But I'm already a second year! I'm not sure how to feel about being considered a "child actor"...
        Well, I'm happy to get the roles either way. I do love acting, after all.
        Plus, Ra*bits is struggling a bit right now with how we have to do solo gigs on the side to get by.
    
    
        It's the same for Nii-chan, who's already gone off to college. Each of us has to improve our own skills to gain individual popularity.
        By doing so, we can draw attention to the unit.
        That's why I want to make a name for myself as an actor.
    
    
        However, I want to be noticed as an idol and for Ra*bits.
        Our agency, Rhythm Link, is well-known and has a long history. It's pretty hard to stand out.
        These guys tend to prioritize seniority over merit, so the people who've been here for a long time take all the high-profile jobs.
        We rarely get any worthwhile opportunities.
    
    
        Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm not criticizing the agency.
        That's one reason why we chose to be in Rhythm Link. Their status and long history can be beneficial to us!
    
    
        Anyways... Umm, what was I talking about again? I always lose myself when I get too excited.
    
    
        Where was I? Well, I was given the chance to perform with a fairly renowned theater company.
        I was cast as a little clown or, to be more precise, a mischievous fairy.
    
    
        Yep, it's similar to Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream. I play a trickster who skips across the stage and causes trouble.
        The role reminded me of two guys I look up to, so I was really motivated!
    
    
        Yet I wasn't able to pull it off... Back at my school's Drama Club, I only played as princes and princesses. I'd over-exaggerate my parts no matter what I do.
        I don't have to ask anyone to tell nobody's going to find my performance entertaining as is.
        I was too stiff, let alone playful. So the feeling of a mischievous fairy didn't come across at all.
    
    
        Huh? I should mimic Ra*bits' behavior instead?
        Sure, I guess we get treated like fairies sometimes.
    
    
        But our behavior typically resembles what good kids do. My role requires pulling pranks and having a sharp tongue, so I don't think that fits...
        If I emphasize Ra*bits too much, I would tarnish our pure and innocent image.
        Maybe people will grow tired of us if we just stick to being good kids.
    
    
        However, that's only the brand we made for Ra*bits.
        I want to keep that image. I know I'm trying to eat my cake and have it too...
    
    
        But a true actor—a true idol—makes the impossible possible and turns dreams into reality. That is who I, Tomoya Mashiro, aspire to be.
    



CommentsThe lines Tomoya acted out in the first three lines seem to reference what Wataru said in Transparency and Masks...?

Come, curse me. Throw stones at this lying coward... Please, spit at and kick this horrible imposter who plays with people&#39;s hearts.

    <content><![CDATA[No one should be surprised that I ended up liking the character with a similar speech style to Wataru&#39;s.
Series: Uma MusumeCharacters: Agnes Tachyon, Manhattan Cafe, Sakura Bakushin OTLC: euni2319

    








    My head hurts...


(Huh... Where the hell am I...?)



    I slowly awaken from the dark state that surrounded me when—


Location: Nurse&#39;s Office





    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        ......Oh, have you woken up?
    


A-Agnes Tachyon...?



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        You appear to be a bit confused. You did just regain consciousness, so you better not exert yourself.
    
  
        Go sit in this chair. Make yourself feel at home.
    



        I sat down in the chair just as she said.



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        Now then... You're probably wondering how you ended up in this situation. Remember anything?
    
  
        By the way, I was the one who brought you over here. Therefore, what you need to remember is "how" and "why" you blacked out.
    


Umm...



        I somehow managed to wrap my throbbing head around this. If I recall correctly, I was walking down the hallway when...


Location: Hallway



    
    Sakura Bakushin O
    
        Hoooold it! Tachyon-san, wait right hereeeee!
    





    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        Oh my. Whatever is the matter, Bakushin O-kun? It's not like your beloved classroom was burned to a crisp.
    



    
    Sakura Bakushin O
    
        Right! It wasn't burned to a crisp!
    



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        So all is well. I shall take my leave.
    



    
    Sakura Bakushin O
    
        The class prez commands you to stooooop! There is nothing "well" about this at all!
    
  
    It may not be burned to a crisp, but it was very much close to being that!
    



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        There was just a little smoke in the corner, right? Would a class president really be this worked up about that?
    



    
    Sakura Bakushin O
    
        Huh?! Um, hmm... Now that you mention it...
    
  
        Would a benevolent class president forgive something so trivial like filling an entire classroom with smoke...?
    



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        Leniency is a virtue, Class President. If that's all, I'll truly be leaving now—
    



    
    Sakura Bakushin O
    
        ...Wait, no! Thinking of it, the teacher said "bring her to me no matter what she says" eight times!
    
  
        And because of that, I'm not letting you go so easily, Tachyon-saaaan!
    



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        Ahahaha! You truly won't get fooled, huh?
    



    
    Sakura Bakushin O
    
        I'm not going to let you get awayyyy! Bakushin bakushiiiin!
    
  
        Ah! Trainer over there! Don't let Tachyon-san get awayyyy!
    


M-Me...?



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        Hm...? Oop!
    



        ......


Location: Nurse&#39;s Office





    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        ......Hmm, it seems you have recovered some of your memories.
    



        After regaining memory, I realize that the girl in front of me is the one responsible for filling a whole classroom with smoke...


Why did you fill a whole classroom up with smoke...?



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        What a strange question to ask. There's no other answer to this than "it's part of my research"!
    



        When Agnes Tachyon said "research," a mysterious sparkle appeared in her eyes.


I have a bad feeling about this...



        It's best to not get involved with her. I was about to stand up when I realized—
        (Creak...)


Huh?! I can&#39;t move?!



        I got tied to the chair without noticing...!



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        Are you the type of person to get so lost in thought that you forget your surroundings? I'm also the same, so I can't say I don't know how that feels.
    
  
        Nevertheless, I shall kindly advise you to keep an eye on your surroundings at all times.
    
  
        After all, you'll never know when you run into a researcher that's looking for a healthy, adult test subject.
    


T-Test subject...?!



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        As for me, I'd say it's good luck that you came around. Maybe I should thank God every once in a while.
    
  
        Everyone in the school knows about me at this point. I can barely ask anyone to be my test subject before they run away from me.
    
  
        Despite all of that— Hahaha! A total newcomer who has never heard of the rumors about me manifested right in front of my eyes! What are the chances?!
    
  
        And so, little guinea pig—I mean, Rookie Trainer.
    


Did you just call me a guinea pig?!



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        A grown man should not worry about such trivial matters!
    
  
        That aside, I'll be giving you a— Actually, since you're big and strong, I'll be giving you three pills to take.
    


What are these pills for...?



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        Ghehehe. Well, that is for you to find out.
    
  
        Don't worry about it... The worst that could happen is that both of your legs would start glowing green for while. Isn't that a cute side effect?
    
  
        What's more important is being able to observe the effects of the human quadriceps contracting caused by this drug.
    
  
        It is a well known fact that horse girls and humans have almost identical body structures. However, by comparing symptoms from both species, it's possible to develop a new—
    



    
    Manhattan Cafe
    
        Tachyon-san... What are you doing this time...?
    



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        Oh hello, Cafe! What's the matter? Are you going to help me with my experi—
    



    
    Manhattan Cafe
    
        I am not. I'm only here because the teacher's calling you. It seems they want to discuss your participation in the next race...
    
  
        They're waiting. Hurry up and go... Right now...
    



    
    Agnes Tachyon
    
        Alright, alright. I get it. No need to make that scary face at me! Looks like we're out of time. I'll be conducting the tests at a later date.
    
  
        Until we meet again, Rookie Trainer!
    



    
    Manhattan Cafe
    
        ...Sigh. I'll untie you.
    



        I am—from the bottom of my heart—so grateful that I've been "saved."

Series: Ensemble Stars!!Gacha: Feature Scout: Tsumugi EditionWriter: YuumasuCharacters: Koga Ogami, Nazuna Nito, Subaru Akehoshi, Tomoya Mashiro, Wataru HibikiTL: haranami, Ren





Season: SummerLocation: Seisou Hall Courtyard





Mentions of animal death within



    
    Subaru
    
    Daikichi, Leon, lookie here~☆
    Ta-da! It's a frisbee! Whoever gets it first wins the game! ☆
    
  
    Allllright☆ Ready and... Fetch!
  



    
    Koga
    
    Don't you lose, Leon. You've gotta show everyone that you're better than these chumps!
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    Do your best, Daikichi. If you get first place, you'll get this gourmet beef jerky♪
  



    
    Nazuna
    
    Heeey, I brought some stuff we can use to set up the obstacle course!
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    Thanks, Nii~chan! We could use the chairs and clothes line to make a hurdle.
  



    
    Koga
    
    Woah, you brought some nets too. They're a must for obstacle races, but why the hell were these even in the dorms?
  



    
    Nazuna
    
    I brought these from Yumenosaki. I asked the tennis team's advisor if I could borrow some, but he ended up just giving me all of these old nets.
    He was about to throw them all away, so he was glad I could take them off his hands.
  
  
    ...Oh, look at Leon. He's jumping around with a frisbee in his mouth~
  



    
    Koga
    
    That's my partner for ya. He didn't even break a sweat.
  



    
    Subaru
    
    You worked really hard, didn't you, Daikichi? There, there. You're deeefinitely gonna win next time...☆
    



    
    Tomoya
    
    Both Leon and Daikichi seem quite happy. Animals really do heal your soul...
  



    
    Nazuna
    
    You're the only one in ANIMALS that doesn't have a pet, Tomo-chin. Don't you want one?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    Yeah. You're allowed to keep pets here, so I guess it'd be fine to have one...♪
    But I never had a pet before. Do you guys have any recommendations for a beginner?
  



    
    Koga
    
    A dog, obviously. I get if ya dunno what breed to get, though.
  



    
    Subaru
    
    Yup! Dogs are great~ They're obedient; and they'll keep you in great shape too 'cause you'll need to walk 'em every day☆
    



    
    Nazuna
    
    Rabbits are just as great! They're easy to take care of—and more importantly, they're super cute! ♪
    If you're a beginner, maybe a pet you can keep indoors—like a hamster—would be good. I heard hedgehogs are easy to take care of too.
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    Huh, you can keep hedgehogs as pets?
  
  
    I guess those are good too... But like, I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the choices.
  



    
    Koga
    
    Point is, you've gotta take responsibility of 'em 'til the end, got that? Pets aren't just any other animals. They're your partners, your family.
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    Ah, right. Humans have longer life spans than most animals, huh...
  
  
    I remember now. I never wanted to have a pet because it'd be so hard to say goodbye to them.
    The more we spend time together, the more painful it'd be to part with them...
  



    
    Wataru
    
    Ah, but aren't you aware that you'll miss out on so many important encounters if you fear parting too much?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    Whoa! Was that Hibiki-senpai?
  



    
    Nazuna
    
    Yeah. Who else would that be, anyway?
  



    
    Subaru
    
    Huh? There's something moving in your shirt, Tomoya-kun.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
    Eh— Eeek!? When did a dove get in here?
  



    
    Wataru
    
    My dove isn't the only one here; I've come along as well.
    Greetings from behind your back! 'Tis I, your Wataru Hibiki...☆
  
  
    I'm practically green with envy, seeing all the members of ANIMALS enjoy themselves without me! How lonely it is to be left out! Sniff, sniff.
  



    
    Koga
    
    The hell are ya sayin'? You're the one who told us you couldn't come 'cause of work.
  



    
    Wataru
    
    Hehehe, that's correct...☆ However, I managed to finish earlier than expected, so I came to join you all.
  
  
    By the way, Tomoya-kun. Do you have any recollection of that dove you're holding?
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    "Recollection"... Ah, is this Jeanne d'Arc?
  



    
    Wataru
    
    That's absolutely correct; this is the child you saved. She hasn't been bullied by those around her at all lately, and now—as you can see—she's doing perfectly well.[1]
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    "Saved"? You're exaggerating. You were the one who actually took care of her.
  



    
    Wataru
    
    However, if you hadn't brought her to me, I wouldn't have even known she was in such a state. And she surely wouldn't have emerged unscathed either.
    So you truly did save her, Tomoya-kun.
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    H-Huh... Thanks.
  



    
    Wataru
    
    You were speaking of life spans just now, correct?
    As I'm sure you're aware, although there are exceptions, animals tend to have shorter life spans than humans.
  
  
    But that is precisely why we live with them and watch over them.
    We need to create an abundance of memories with them so that we never forget the fact that they lived here, by our sides. That is the duty of us creatures who live longer, I believe.
  
  
    In any case, I cannot recommend that you take a pet under your wing on a mere whim. Until you come to a proper decision, it would be best for you to satisfy yourself with ANIMALS' activities.
  



    
    Subaru
    
    Yup, yup! Lemme know anytime you wanna go on a walk with Daikichi☆
  



    
    Koga
    
    Leon's a lone wolf, but he'll let you pet him—don't make a habit of it, though.
  



    
    Nazuna
    
    And come to my room whenever you feel like spending time with rabbits. I'll make sure you enjoy their fluffiness~♪
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    Haha... Thank you, everyone!
  



    
    Wataru
    
    Speaking of walks... Dogs naturally need them, but were you aware that you can take doves on walks too?
  



    
    Subaru
    
    How d'you take doves on walks, though? Do you just put 'em on your shoulders?
  



    
    Wataru
    
    Not at all. I take them on walks through the sky in my hot air balloon, you see.
  
  
    On that note, Tomoya-kun, let us do exactly that...☆
  



    
    Tomoya
    
    Woaaah! Don't jump onto the balloon while carrying meee! P-Put me down~!

Translation Notes
    
        卯の花 (unohana) is a pseudonym for Deutzia crenata, a white flowering shrub native to (and common in) Japan. The "卯" in the name refers to the fourth Chinese zodiac, the rabbit, due to the flowers blooming in April. Its other name, ウツギ/空木 (utsugi), comes from its hollow stems. 空木 means "empty shrub" literally.
    
  
    卯の花色 (unohana-iro) is yellow-tinted white color ★ (#FBFBF6). Kotobank and the Color Dictionary lists it as a blue-tinted white color ★ (#F7FCFE).
  
  
    Tomoya's last name, Mashiro (真白), means pure white or blank. This will play a role in the second chapter.
  
    Chapter 2 spoilers 
    
      
        The title of this story appears to be from Wataru to Tomoya, thanks to these lines:
        
          Everything you wear will suit you, and as such you'll be able to play any role you'd like. Just like your name, you are a canvas of pure white. You can be painted in any color; you can become anything your heart desires.
        
        
          A wonderful choice. You're still a blank canvas at the moment; I can't help but wonder what colors you'll paint yourself with in the future... I grow more and more eager to observe your growth.

        Alright. Good work today, Narukami.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Thanks for all the hard work! I'll do my best too!
    
    
        (I could practice on my own, but I already memorized all of my lines... I guess I'll just focus on this thing for now.)
    
    
        (My personalized outfit... I was overjoyed when Anzu-san said it was my turn to get one but...)
        (The moment she asked what kind of outfit I'd like, my mind went blank—I totally panicked. It was so embarrassing.)
        (She told me to tell her if I had any ideas, but I can't even think of a single one that's good...)
    
    
        (How did everyone else come up with their personalized outfits? Should I go check on HoldHands?)
    
    
        (...Narukami-senpai looks quite refined. She doesn't have a lot of accessories on, but that's exactly what makes her own beauty stand out.)
        (Kanzaki-senpai's costume has his family crest on it. Doesn't get any better than that, huh? It suits him—he looks really cool.)
        (It's amazing to see how everyone's characters were brought out.)
    
    
        ("Characters," huh... A personalized outfit is supposed to represent one's character, but there's nothing special about me.)
    
    
        (...Oh, it's a picture of Mitsuru. When he came to show me his, he said something like, "I was thinkin' about what made me wanna become an idol!")
        (Maybe I can draw some inspiration from that?)
    
    
        (The reason why I want to become an idol was because "the idols I saw on TV looked amazing.")
        (But there's absolutely nothing special about that! It's so basic! Looks that idea's thrown out the window... Ugh.)
    



    
    Hokuto
    
        Tomoya, what's wrong? Is there something on your mind?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ah, Hokuto-senpai.
    



    
    Hokuto
    
        Your acting just now was on point, so I don't believe you have any need to worry about that... However, if you feel you need more practice, I can stay behind with you.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. Thank you. To be honest, I was actually worrying about something, but it's not related to acting...
        It's about my personalized outfit. I can't come up with any ideas no matter what I do.
    
    
        How were you able to come up with yours, Hokuto-senpai?
    



    
    Hokuto
    
        How did I? Mm, I had a person in mind as my target. That's all.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        A "target," huh...
    
    
        (My goal is to become a dazzling, magnificent idol. They are pretty much like, admiration personified. But...)
        (Exactly what do people in this world admire?)
    


Location: Costume Room





    
    Tomoya
    
        Sorry for making you come with me.
    



    
    Hokuto
    
        I don't mind; my adorable junior asked me to, after all. Anyway, shouldn't you keep trying clothes on?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ah, right. I'll try this outfit on next!
    
    
        (I think people admire protagonists in plays and movies.)
        (So I'm trying out some stage clothes to see if any good ideas pop up. However...)
    
    
        The next costume I'll try on is from One Thousand and One Nights!
    



    
    Hokuto
    
        Mm. It's just as cute as the Mermaid Prince outfit you tried on before.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Thank you. That's the fifth time in a row you said I was "cute." I was hoping that you'd say something other than that.
    



    
    Hokuto
    
        Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to say so each time, it's just how I feel.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        No need to apologize! I'm just bad at being anything that isn't "cute," so it's all on me!
        Every word that comes out of your mouth should be written down, framed, and displayed in a museum!
    
    
        So! I'm gonna try and find an outfit that'll make you say something other than "cute"!
    
    
        Not this one... And not this one either...
    
    
        Aha, this is it! I'll try on The Emperor's New Clothes next!
    



    
    Hokuto
    
        Hold on, Tomoya. You'll be basically wearing nothing at all with that, so it's not much help as a reference, is it?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You'll never know unless you try. You might even be surprised at how well it fits.
        Besides, everyone else's personalized outfit made them stand out. I wanna stand out just as much as them! If I don't do this, I'll—
    



    
    ???
    
        Ohh, how splendid!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Woah!? A dove just came out of that sleeve... And it's talking!
    



    
    Hokuto
    
        Pull yourself together, Tomoya. No matter how you look at it, this is just one of that guy's tricks.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        "That guy's"... Ah.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehehe. So the both of you are thinking of me?
    
    
        Well, you're correct! The one who spoke just now was not this dove, but rather I! Your very own Wataru Hibiki...☆
    
    
        Tomoya-kun. Have you finally come up with an idea for your personalized outfit after trying on costume after costume?
    
    
        King Lear, Macbeth, Romeo, Sherlock Holmes, Qin Shi Huang, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Ryoma Sakamoto, Napoleon Bonaparte...
    
    
        What do you want to be? Who do you want to be?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Huh. "Who"...?
    
    
        (With how I kept trying clothes on, it's not surprising I feel this way. But...)
        (I kept trying to become someone else... Is this truly "Tomoya Mashiro"?)

Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: YuumasuCharacters: Hajime Shino, Hokuto Hidaka, Tomoya Mashiro, Wataru HibikiTL: Peace, RenTLC/QC: haranami





Season: SummerLocation: Costume Room





    
    Tomoya
    
        (...Looks like I misunderstood something.)
        (It's fun acting as other people on stage. Like, it's as if you've become a whole different person.)
    
    
        (But that is only the actor "Tomoya Mashiro," not the idol "Tomoya Mashiro.")
        (As an idol on stage, I have to fight as the person I truly am.)
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Oh? There's truly no need for you to look so despondent.
        Everything you wear will suit you, and as such you'll be able to play any role you'd like. Just like your name, you are a canvas of pure white[1]. You can be painted in any color; you can become anything your heart desires.
        Perhaps I can only view this so positively because it is precisely what I am lacking, but...
    
    
        Your "problem" is actually a skill that those with strong personalities cannot obtain no matter how desperately they may wish to.
    



    
    Hokuto
    
        That's right, Tomoya. I'm not saying you're cute without any thought, I really do think so.
        You can become whoever and whatever you'd like. With that in mind, why don't you think again about what you'd like to be?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Thank you, Hibiki-senpai, Hokuto-senpai...
        I'm going to rethink on how to design my personalized outfit from scratch.
    


Location: Seisou Hall Common Room





    
    Tomoya
    
        (I'm watching some idol concerts as reference.)
        (...Idols really are amazing, huh. They're always shining and full of joy.)
        (The venue is completely packed. I used to be right there, just another member of the audience, before I became an idol.)
    



    
    Hajime
    
        Tomoya-kun, would you like to drink some warm milk with me?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh, Hajime... Yeah, sure. Thanks.
    



    
    Hajime
    
        Don't mention it. Is it alright if I sit next to you? I'd like to watch the concert too.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Of course. We're friends, after all. You don't have to ask for permission every time.
    



    
    Hajime
    
        Ehehehe, alright then. I'll plop right down♪
    
    
        ...Tomoya-kun, are you worried about your personalized outfit by chance?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Uh... What makes you think that?
    



    
    Hajime
    
        We're friends, aren't we? I felt like that might be the case.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Haha, yep. You saw right through me... It's just as you say: I'm worrying about my personalized outfit—to the point where I'm starting to panic a bit.
    





    
    Tomoya
    
        Mitsuru was able to come up with a design that suits him, so why can't I do the same?
        I don't really know what my idol self is like at all...
    
    
        I was trying to do what Mitsuru did: use the reason why I became an idol as a reference. However, my reason for becoming an idol is so boring... "The idols I saw on TV looked amazing! Maybe I could become one too," and such...
    



    
    Hajime
    
        Mm-mm, I don't think it's a boring reason at all... Do you remember what I told you a long, looong time ago?
        I said that I wasn't really interested in idols. That I loved you and didn't want be separated from you, so I just tagged along without a single thought.
    
    
        Tomoya-kun, you were the one who always stood by my side, no matter how painful and miserable it got.
        You befriended me, and even the reason I'm here now is because you wanted to be an idol.
    
    
        Without you, the idol "Hajime Shino" wouldn't exist. I've always been considered such a dunce by others, so by now I surely would've been left behind in the dust—
        I might've even stopped trying to catch up to you. I might've just given up and cried, all alone. So please... Don't call your reason boring.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Hajime... Yeah, I understand.
    
    
        (If I never thought of becoming an idol, I wouldn't be where I'm at now.)
        (I would've never met Mitsuru and Nii~chan. I would've been living a dull, uneventful life.)
    
    
        (Becoming an idol was a critical turning point in life for me. Even though my reason for wanting to be one is pretty boring and worthless, I don't need to keep comparing it to others.)
    
    
        Well, why don't we brainstorm ideas for a personalized outfit together? If you don't mind. You know me too well, anyways...
        With you, I feel like I could come up with a design that's like those idols I've always admired—the idols that shine beyond the screen.
    



    
    Hajime
    
        Tomoya-kun... Yes, of course! ♪
    


Location: Starmaker Production Lobby





    
    Tomoya
    
        (I finished brainstorming for my personalized outfit, so I brought all the sheets here but...)
    
    
        Hibiki-senpai's not here, huh... Maybe I should've just called him upfront on HoldHands.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hoho. I was wondering who you were searching for—to think that it was me.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Eep! D-Don't just show up out of the blue! You should've just called out to me... Geez.
    
    
        Here. This is the design for my personalized outfit. I took your advice and such, so I thought I'd better show the final outcome to you.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        So you decided on a design that draws inspiration from idols in the end.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah. I'm not able bring out the idol "Tomoya Mashiro's" character yet... Which is why the classic idol outfit is the best choice!
    



    
    Wataru
    
        A wonderful choice. You're still a blank[1] canvas at the moment; I can't help but wonder what colors you'll paint yourself with in the future... I grow more and more eager to observe your growth.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. I'm also looking forward to what my future as an idol holds.
    
    
        This is only the first step... With this costume, I shall march towards that future with confidence!
    



    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑↑ A play on Tomoya's last name, Mashiro (真白). It can be translated as pure white or blank.
    
    
        The title, To the Deutzia-Colored You, appears to be from Wataru's point of view and references the two lines mentioned above.

    Emu
    
        Alright! Good work today, everyone!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Yeah, see you tomorrow!
    



    
    Rui
    
        Good work today.
    



    
    Nene
    
        Good work.
    
  
        ......
    
  
        (Everyone went home already, but I still want to practice a bit more.)
    
  
        U-Umph!
    



    
    NeneRobo
  
        ......
    



    
    Nene
    
        You're the audience today, NeneRobo, so...
        Please watch me sing.
    



    
    NeneRobo
  
        ......
    



    
    Nene
    
        —♪
    
  
    (It's alright. I'm able to sing on stage.)
    (But...)
    
  
        (I wonder if I'm able to sing the same way in front of an audience.)
    (What if I mess up again...?)
    
  
        Whew...
    
  
        Thank you all for listening.
    
  
        I can finally stand on stage by myself.
    But I think this was all thanks to NeneRobo being there for me.
    
  
        I guess that's why I'd get scared every time I got near the stage...
    Because you weren't there with me.
    



    
    Rui
    
        ......I see, I see.
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Eep!?
    



    
    Rui
    
        So that's the reason why you kept bringing her around, even though she already finished her job.
    



    
    Nene
    
        W-Where the hell did you come from...?
    



    
    Rui
    
        Hehe.
        I just happened to be here, so it's the perfect time to make the "surprise visit" trope a reality.
    



    
    Nene
    
        The hell?
    



    
    Rui
    
        Now, now.
    Apologizes that it seemed like I was eavesdropping.
    
  
        I have a present for you, see?
    Your favorite grapefruit juice!
    



    
    Nene
    
        Are you trying to fool me now?
    



    
    Rui
    
        Heheheh, I suppose you could say that.
    
  
        However...
    
  
        Despite not using her on stage anymore, it looks like you're taking good care of NeneRobo.
    



    
    Nene
  
        ......
    



    
    Rui
    
        It's safe to say that this robot completed her role and fulfilled your dream.
    
  
        But she's not leaving the stage as long as she's needed.
    



    
    Nene
  
        What do you mean by that?
    



    
    Rui
    
        I have a proposal.
    Will you allow me to keep this robot for a while?
    



    
    Nene
  
        Huh? Are you gonna remodel it?
    



    
    Rui
    
        I would never do that.
    Rather, I'm going to add some improvements to her.
    



    
    Nene
  
        "Improvements"...?
    



    
    Rui
    
        She's a very high performing robot.
    I'll think of ways to make her more user friendly.
    
  
        That way, you'll have full control of her and can stand on stage together.
    



    
    Nene
  
        You're alright with that?
    



    
    Rui
    
        Of course.
    It's a director's responsibility to lend an ear to their performers.
    



    
    Nene
  
        ...Mhm.
    
  
        But if you add anything weird, I'll get pissed. Got it?

Location: Phoenix Wonderland - Wonder Stage





    
    Tsukasa
    
        With that, the meeting is now in session!
    
    
        I want to add some novel, never-before-seen acts in our upcoming show.
        Give me some ideas on what you'd like to see in it!
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Uhm.
    



    
    Emu
    
        Oh, oh! I got one!
        We can all start flying across the sky!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Hmm... Well, it's pretty flashy, but it's not original at all!
        Step it up a notch!
    



    
    Emu
    
        We could all explode then!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        How is exploding supposed to help us!?
    



    
    Emu
    
        Going "KABOOM!" is undoubtedly really flashy and striking!
        We could use something like colored smoke!
    
    
        Oh! And I'll be red!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Hold on, I'm supposed to be red!
        Leaders have been associated with red since ancient times!
    
    
        However, if the smoke is too flashy, the audience wouldn't be able to see the stage...
        Your idea has been rejected—once again!
    
    
        Who else would like to share?
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...I hav—
    



    
    Emu
    
        I got another!
        Let's just explode without the smoke!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Enough with the explosions!
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Could you ple—
    



    
    Rui
    
        Everyone, it appears that Nene has an ingenious idea.
    



    
    Emu
    
        M-Mmph!?
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        (Did that guy just shove a donut right into Emu's mouth at lightning speed!?)
    



    
    Emu
    
        M-Mmmph...? Nom nom nom...
    



    
    Rui
    
        Your turn, Nene.
    



    
    Nene
    
        (That was so unnecessary.)
    
    
        Rui's been adding some improvements to NeneRobo...
    
    
        So that we can both stand on stage together...
    
    
        (Tsukasa would much rather be the one in the spotlight instead of a robot, so I doubt he'll agree. But...)
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        NeneRobo, huh? Right.
        What kind of acts will it do?
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Eh?
    
    
        (Wait, that's a good reaction... I think.)
    
    
        Err... Um...
        That'll depend on what Rui's adding in.
    



    
    Rui
    
        Well, then. How about this?
        First, we'll have her go onstage by herself...
    





    
    Emu
    
        I see, I see! How interestin'!
        I'll sink about it!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Don't you mean "think"!?
    
    
        Regardless, this is a never-before-seen act.
        You got my seal of approval!
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...I'm glad.
    



    
    Emu
    
        I wonder what kind of things NeneRobo-chan can do? This'll be fun!
    



    
    Rui
    
        Surely. Do look forward to it.
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Mm.
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        In any respect, I shall always be the star of the stage, no matter what improvements were made!
    



    
    Nene
    
        Shut up, Flopstar.
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        F-Flop!?
    



    
    Emu
    
        "Flop"...? Okay, you'll be Mister Flala today!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Why me!?
    



    
    Rui
    
        It's such a syncopated name though, Mister Flala.
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Y-You all better stop!
        Do not give me a foolish, unrefined nickname!
    



    
    Nene
    
        But Flala, you aren't foolish; you are a fool.
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Why y—on top of calling me a fool, you even removed the "mister"!
    



    
    Emu
    
        Flala-flala, lop-lop, fla-la-la-lop~♪
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Stop, stooop!
        Don't you dare make it into an arcane song and dance to ittttt!
    



    
    Nene
    
        ......Heh.

Series: Ensemble Stars!Characters: Tomoya Mashiro, Wataru Hibiki




 1/3


  
  Tomoya
  
     "G-Good mornin', Stepmother."
  
  
     Ugh... That came out stiff, huh.
  
  
     "Good morning, Stepmother." Alright, now that's more like Cinderella...♪
  


Nope. Not even close. Shall I show you an example of how to do it?


Possibility 1Possibility 2
  
  Tomoya
  
     Alright, sur— Wait, why are you acting all excited before I finished my sentence?!
  
  
     Well, you are the club president after all.
   So of course you can act Cinderella better than me. I'm still learning, y'know.
  

  
  Tomoya
  
     S-Sure...
  
  
     What, I'm too straightforward? And you're a good-for-nothing pervert.
   I have little confidence in my acting, y'know?
  


&quot;Morning, Cinderella&quot;


Possibility 1Possibility 2
  
  Tomoya
  
     Woah, it's the Masked Pervert— I-I mean, Stepmother.
  
  
     Yeah, yeah. I know, the show starts soon.
   I gotta play Cinderella perfectly.
  

  
  Tomoya
  
     What was that for?! It's not morning anymore...
   Huh? ...Ah, so you were replying as the Stepmother.
  
  
     Ughh~ I can't get into my role at all.
  


 2/3


  
  Tomoya
  
     Let's see... So I'm Cinderella, Hokuto-senpai's the First Prince...
   Hasumi-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai are the stepsisters, Kiryu-senpai's the Second Prince...
  
  
     And the Masked Pervert's both the Stepmother and Fairy Godmother. It'll be alright. I got this.
  


&quot;Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo♪&quot;


Possibility 1Possibility 2
  
  Tomoya
  
     Gwah?! Wait, I don't want flowers—
   ...I lost a point? It wasn't Cinderella-like?
  
  
     Urgh... I didn't act quickly enough, so I can't blame you for deducting points.
  

  
  Tomoya
  
     Err, you did magic right now so...
  
  
     "Thank you, Fairy Godmother. With this, I can go to the ball."
   Heheh. Ask and you shall receive!
  


&quot;Is everything nice and clean, Cinderella?&quot;


Possibility 1Possibility 2
  
  Tomoya
  
     "I finished cleaning not so long ago."
   "I'll be preparing your meal next."
  
  
     ...Hm? Oh, I just acted out what I think Cinderella would say.
  

  
  Tomoya
  
     "I'm sorry, Stepmother."
   "I tripped on a bucket of water and flooded the hallway..."
  
  
     Hmm. It's better to do nothing if I'm just going to break the dishes and dirty the laundry.
  


 3/3


  
  Tomoya
  
     Breathe in... Breathe out...♪
  
  
     Alright, I'm all fired up now. Time to show the audience what all that practicing was for!
  
  
     ...Ugh, I'm still as nervous as before. Am I even gonna make it to the end?
  


There&#39;s no need to fret. I&#39;m sure you can do it.


Possibility 1Possibility 2
  
  Tomoya
  
     I know. You gave me this role because you knew I could do it.
  
  
     Hmm, even though it feels like you just gave it to me for your own amusement...
   I still hope you have high expectations for me!
  

  
  Tomoya
  
     ...Thank you, President.
  
  
     It feels weird to express my thanks to you so openly but...
   I'm doing my best, so keep your eyes on me, okay?
  


Believe in yourself.


Possibility 1Possibility 2
  
  Tomoya
  
     ...I guess.
   I can't get into my role if I don't have any confidence in myself.
  
  
     I would just have to believe that I could do it.
  

  
  Tomoya
  
     Believe in...myself?
  
  
     That's surprising for you to say... Since you're nothing even like what a club president should be.
   But I guess what you said resonates[1] with me. Just a little bit.
  


Translation Notes
    
        ↑ Tomoya uses "胸に響きました" (mune ni hibikimashita) here. Yes, this is an allusion to Wataru's surname.
