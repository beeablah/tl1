Writer&#39;s Comment
I was the guy in charge of writing Dead End Land~ While researching to decide on a chapter name, I came across the idiom &quot;生死妄念.&quot; Meaning &quot;to be lost[1] in your destructive thoughts forever, even when you reincarnate,&quot; which suits Mayoi perfectly! He&#39;s literally the personification of it! (He&#39;s not)  ➹

Translation Notes
    
        ↑ "迷まよい" (/ma̠jo̞i/ mayoi) is translated as "lost" here, but it can also mean doubt, delusion, etc. In Buddhism, it refers to the inability to reach enlightenment.

氷に閉じこめて (Koori ni tojikomete) / Locked in Ice
Series: PromareArtist: SuperflyLyrics, composition: Shiho Ochi


漢字RomajiEnglish君は氷のように　冷たいけど炎のような愛じゃ　解けちゃうけど
魔法に掛かるからまだ　愛してもいいかな
見透かされてるようで　苦しいからいつも遠い場所に　逃げちゃうのね
魔法に掛けられてもっと　いい子にしてるからまだ　信じても良いかな
私を凍らせて　今すぐ嘘も本当も　抱き締めてあげるから行かないで　消えないであの街の　雪の中に光など見つけないでよ
君がいなくなると　灰になるの燃え上がる想いが　焼き尽すの
もう一度　夢が叶うなら幸せに還りたい待っててもいいかな愛は生き延びるはず
氷に閉じこめて　この手が頬に心に　触れられるその瞬間ときまで解けないわ　泣かないわ美しき　氷の鎧最後まで君を待ってる
氷に閉じこめて　この手が頬に心に　触れられるその瞬間ときまで解けないわ　泣かないわ美しき　氷の鎧最後まで君を待ってるKimi wa koori no you ni tsumetai kedoHonoo no you na ai ja tokechau kedo

But since you cast a spell on meI wonder if it&#39;s okay to love you
It&#39;s painful having your true feelings revealedSo you always run away to some place far away
I&#39;m a much better kidBut since I&#39;m under your spellI wonder if it&#39;s okay to believe you
Freeze me right nowI&#39;ll embrace your truths and liesDon&#39;t go, don&#39;t disappearDon&#39;t find the lightAmidst that snowswept town
If you leave, I&#39;ll be reduced to ashesThese blazing feelings for you will burn to nothing
If dreams can come true againThen I&#39;d like to go back to being happyI wonder if it&#39;s a good idea to waitI know our love will survive
Lock me in ice; I won&#39;t melt, I won&#39;t cryUntil the moment my handGets to touch your cheeks and heartI&#39;ll wait for you until the very endIn this beautiful cage made of ice
Lock me in ice; I won&#39;t melt, I won&#39;t cryUntil the moment my handGets to touch your cheeks and heartI&#39;ll wait for you until the very endIn this beautiful cage made of ice

    <title>Phoenix&#39;s Favorite Food</title>
    <url>/tl/post/nrhd_apples/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[An apple a day keeps anyone away, if you throw it hard enough.
Series: Ace AttorneySource: Nintendo DREAM July 2016 IssueCharacters: Phoenix Wright, Trucy WrightSpecial Thanks: Lloyd






    
    Trucy
    
        The question is, "What is your favorite food or drink and why?"
    



    
    Phoenix
    
        My favorite food, huh...
    



    
    Trucy
    
        It's apples, right, Daddy?
    



    
    Phoenix
    
        Well, I don't hate them.
    



    
    Trucy
    
        It must feel nice crunching through all that "red stuff."[1]
        Though, you said it would be even better if it had white frills[2] on it.
    



    
    Phoenix
    
        Wait, I don't remember saying that.
    



    
    Trucy
    
        Huh?
        Didn't you eat apples a lot after trials back then?
        You bit into them with a glare as if it's your enemy.
    
    
        ...Or at least, that's what I heard from Miss Fey.
    



    
    Phoenix
    
        M-Maya...
        Trucy, you really shouldn't trust her.
    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ 赤いヤツ can also be translated as "red guy."
    
    
        ↑ 白いヒラヒラ = white frills. Often used to describe Edgeworth's jabot cravat.

    Tsubasa
    
        What's wrong, Teru-san? Did you get injured somewhere?
    



    
    Teru
    
        Nah, it just hurts if I press down on my skin here. I think it's a pressure point.
        Hey, Sakuraba. Do you know which body part this pressure point connects to?
    



    
    Kaoru
    
        Dunno. It's probably a stupid one since it's you.
    



    
    Teru
    
        What!? Hmm... If it's gonna be like that, I wonder how you'll react.
        If you feel pain when I press here, then it means you're also stupid! Take that!
    



    
    Kaoru
    
        I-It doesn't hurt... I really don't feel any pain... I'm fine! Let me go at once...!

        Wow, seriously hiding the pai—
    
    
        Oww!? S-Stop! Sakuraba!
    



    
    Tsubasa
    
    I guess it hurts just a bit... I wonder which pressure point it is? I'm curious.

    Riamu
    
        Sigh, I'm depressed. Being an idol isn't fun at all.
        I knew it would suck, but...
        This is depressing. This is just fucking depressing!
        
    
        Aaah, I want someone to comfort me!
        To keep me company, to give me attention, to tell me everything's alright...
        I want it! I wanna be idolized!
    
    
        ...But no one's ever going to idolize me or whatever.
        This break room's walls are the only friends I have!
        Aaah, I'm sooo lonelyyyy!

        It was quite enjoya-ple!
    
    
        What about you, Akira-chan?
    



    
    Akira
    
        Well, that was the first time I had this feeling...
    
    
        Also, there were a lot of idols wearin' good clothes...
        Lots of nice clothes.
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Ehh, it wasn't good enough for me.
        I wanna stand out and get a shit ton of attention...!
    



    
    Akari
    
        Wow... Amazing, Riamu-san...
        You're really unique, and you have a nice dream too.
        I guess that's what being an idol is all about.
    



    
    Akira
    
        I wouldn't say that her dream's that great...
        She definitely has personality, though.
    



    
    Akari
    
        Ugh, I wonder if I can match up to you...
        I'm not the type that stands out too much, y'know?
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Alright then! Let's stir up some drama while we're at it!
        As long as we're together, we'll be fine!
    



    
    Akari & Akira
    
        ...Huh?
    



    
    Akari
    
        No, no! You can't just start drama...!
        All the things you care about will go to waste!
    



    
    Riamu
    
        But there are so many other idols out there!
        If you don't stand out as much as possible, you won't survive!
        Hey, Riamu-chan wants to survive!
    



    
    Akira
    
        Don't.
        Stirrin' up drama will just cause trouble for the agency.
    
    
        Aren't there other ways you can think of to survive?
    



    
    Riamu
    
        I wanna stand out! With drama!
        Isn't starting drama mental?
        I wanna stand out as a joke!
    



    
    Akira
    
    Eh...
    Riamu-san, why are you so problematic...?
    



    
    Riamu
    
        It's because I wanna stand out!
        Because I want people to care about me!
        Because I wanna get some attention, at least!
    



    
    Akira
    
        If it's like that, then there should be another way.
        With drama, you'd constantly have to worry about dealin' with radical opinions.
    



    
    Riamu
    
        ...So, I should just join the military.
    



    
    Akari
    
        The military!? What the he—
        Ah, I mean, why?
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Because people in the military are really smart, obviously!
        Let's come up with some genius ideas that'll turn me into a cool officer character!
    
    
        I'm 19, y'know!?
        I want my juniors to rely on me!
        I wanna make you two happy!
    



    
    Akari
    
        W-What should we do, Akira-chan?
        Riamu-san saying all of that isn't any good!
    



    
    Akira
    
        Hey, both of you calm down.
    
    
        First off, it makes no sense to havin' a panic attack here.
        Don't people relax here?
    



    
    Akari
    
        T-That's right! Ahahahaha!
        I just started panicking all of a sudden!
        Uh... Hm... Eh...
    
    
        Ah!
        Why don't we get some ramen?
    



    
    Akira & Riamu
    
        Ramen?
    



    
    Akari
    
        Let's go eat!
        Eating tasty food with friends always cheers me up!
    
    
        Cheer up, Riamu-san.
        Your problematic thoughts might go away!
    
    
        Besides, Tokyo's ramen always looked so trendy and delicious. I've always wanted to try it...!
    



    
    Akira
    
        Ah... In that case, I know a good place.
        It's from my hometown that just opened a Tokyo branch...
        But I guess that isn't really Tokyo ramen, huh.
    



    
    Akari
    
        Aha♪ As long as it's good, it's OK!
    



    
    Riamu
    
        Eh, huh!? What the hell!?
        I'm gonna eat ramen with someone...!?
        Is this a dream? A dream to end all dreams!?
    



    
    Akira
    
        This is reality.
    



    
    Akari
    
        Riamu-san, let's go as a grou-ple♪
    



    
    Riamu
    
        You're joking... You're seriously not joking...?
        Idols are so nice...
        I wuv nice idols...!

    <content><![CDATA[In which the Ninja Association takes up tasks from their newly made request box.
Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: Seitaro KinoCharacters: Mayoi Ayase, Shinobu SengokuTL: KagehirinTLC: HoliQC: Ren





Season: SummerLocation: Yumenosaki Academy




One day in an empty classroom after summer vacation



    
    Shinobu
    
        Mayoi-dono~! Mayoi-dono, might you happen to be present?
    
    
        Hm? It appears that no one is here. We made an appointment to meet in the empty classroom after school, but have I arrived here first?
    



    
    ???
    
        Pant, pant...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Oh...? Is the sound of breathing perhaps coming from...
        ...the inside of that broom closet!?
    





    
        Mayoi
    
        Chiiiief! I knew you'd notice meeeeee♪ You saw right through my camouflage!
        As one would expect from the Ninja Association's leader! I'll follow you for the rest of my life♪
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hehe. My suspicions were correct. It is unthinkable for a reliable person like you to have been late to our meeting, so I knew something had to be up.
    
    
        Anyway, Mayoi-dono, let us begin our club activities for today!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Certainly, let's. Will we be checking the request box today as well?
        I'll start up the PC, and... Oh my, it looks like we received two submissions.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ooh, what a success! We just set it up this week, but we have already received two submissions... It appears our efforts have been noticed!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Receiving anonymous requests like this is fun... It feels quite ninja-like.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Well, to be precise, it is hero work. But it fits us too, since we're ninjas of justice♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        "Hero" work?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ah, it makes sense that you would not know about this. Last year, Morisawa-dono opened a request box and used it to help those in need~
        There was no one to take it over after he graduated, and thus, I received permission to do so.
    
    
        Morisawa-dono looked delighted; he even said, "It's wonderful that you're reaching out and helping others!"
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I see... So you're carrying on his legacy.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Well, it is not as if I am only doing this out of a sense of justice like Morisawa-dono did; I'm not nearly as saintly, after all...
    
    
        ...Because someday, the Ninja Association will become the Ninja Club!
        If we become an official school club, we will undoubtedly gain more members, and we can receive plenty of funding. It will be just one good thing after another!
        As the head of the Ninja Association, it is natural for that to be my goal!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ufufu. Even if your aim is to obtain a reward, it doesn't change the fact that you're performing good deeds.
        If you need stealth, leave it to me. It's a bad habit of mine to flee and hide when I encounter others, but in the context of being a "ninja," that weakness becomes a strength.
    
    
        And I'd certainly rather be a "ninja" than a "phantom"...♪
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        "Phantom"...?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Oh, it's nothing. Just a personal matter.
    
    
        Ah, oops. Chatting with you is so fun that I ended up prolonging our discussion... Shall we take a look at what we received in the request box?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ah, yes. We should do that.
    
    
        So, what does the box contain this time?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        The first submission is a request to help clean things up around the school. Judging from the manner of speech, it seems to be from the person who sent in a request earlier this week[1] as well.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ooh, it surprises me that we'd get a repeat requester.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Indeed. Perhaps they have been trying to support the Ninja Association by bringing us jobs to help us establish a track record.
        I am unsure of who it is, but if they want the Ninja Association to become a real club, they could be someone within Yumenosaki Academy.
    
    
        Ufufu. It's like they're our "Daddy-Long-Legs"[2]—our mysterious benefactor...♪
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hmm. If that is the case, I feel it would certainly be more fun if they could join the Ninja Association and partake in our activities...
    
    
        No, this also depends on the time frame it is occurring in. Perhaps it could be someone like Mayoi-dono!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
    Huh? M-Me...?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Of course~ I never expected a third year to join the Ninja Association.
        When I think of how I am able to spend this much time with a companion of mine, my heart overflows with gratitude♪
    





    
    Mayoi
    
        C-Chiiiiief...♪ (hugs)
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Mayoi-dono~♪ (hugs back)
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ufufu. To be on a honeymoon with Chief, with no one getting in our way... It's comfortable to the point where I'd be just fine dying in your aaaaarms...♪
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        You mustn't be so hasty! The pair of us are fated companions who have finally managed to cross paths. It is too early to reach the end of our journey!
        There was another request, yes? If so, we must fulfill our duty and be of service.
    
    
        Look, I see another message there. Given the title, I'm quite curious as to what it may contain.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Let's see... Oh, what's this...?
        "A Request to the Members of the Ninja Association: Participate in Our Grand Opening Event"...?
    



    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ In-game, the request is said to be from "last week." However, as Shinobu established earlier, the request box was only set up "this week." It was decided that for the sake of consistency and making any sort of sense, we would write it as "earlier this week" in this chapter. This will be fixed if there are any official changes later on.
    
    
        ↑ A reference to a novel of the same name, in which a girl from an orphanage is given money by an unknown benefactor so that she can go to college. Though she is not allowed to know who he is, it's revealed at the end that a man she met during her time in college and grew attached to was her benefactor.

Season: SummerLocation: Saison Avenue




A few days later



    
    Mayoi
    
        Aah—eep...!?
    
  
        Urgh... People are terrifying... A shopping district like this is simply hell...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Well, experience is the best teacher. I was not terribly good with crowds either, but recently I've been getting a bit more used to them.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I-I see. I feel like no matter what I do, I still end up feeling sick in crowded places...
    
  
    Chief. Would you mind if I took a quick break on that bench over there?
  



    
    Shinobu
    
        That's fine with me~ I shall contact our client to let them know that we will meet up here instead.
    



    
        Mayoi
    
        I-I'm sorry... I probably come off as a terribly feeble individual.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Please don't push yourself too much. You are my one and only companion in the Ninja Association!
    
    
        Ah, right. There is a vending machine close by, so I will go grab something for you to drink. I'm sure that if you hydrate yourself a bit, you will feel better...♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I'm dreadfully sorry for everything I keep putting you through. Thank you very much...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        We have each others' backs~ Well then, I will be right back.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ......
    
  
        (Eek!? S-Someone sat down next to me... Why, for what reason? There should be other empty benches available if they wanted to sit...)
    
  
        (H-Huh? They just said "Good morning," didn't they? To me? I-I wasn't hallucinating, was I...?)
    
  
        (Eep... Is it possibly a fan of mine? I don't feel comfortable just ignoring them, so I should try to say at least something...)
    
  
        D-Do you possibly need something from me...!?
    
  
        Eep! Close, too close! Your face is way too clooooose!
    
  
    Ah, um, I... T-There isn't anything particularly interesting about my face even if you inspect it closely... I think there's some misunderstanding, so please back up a bit...!
  
  
        Oh, Miss Producer...?
    
  
        I-I'm sorry... I'm bad at making eye contact with people, so I didn't realize it was you.
    Aah... That's why you leaned so close to me? To help me remember who you were? Yes, we have met several times in the ES building, so please pardon my rudeness...
    
  
        ......
    
  
        (What an awkward silence...! Should I try to start a conversation about something...?)
    





    
    Shinobu
    
        Oh, you're here, Producer-dono—Anzu-dono. It seems you've already gotten Mayoi-dono to open up♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Aah, Chief! My savior!
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ahaha. You're truly that bad with people?
    
  
    I thought you may have arrived, Anzu-dono, so I bought a bottle of tea for you as well~ Green tea was the only variety available, though.
  
    
        There is no need to offer me words of thanks. You were the one who submitted the request to our box, after all.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ah, you submitted a request anonymously, but then revealed your identity after? I was under the impression that every requester has to remain completely anonymous...
    However, why were we requested for work off-campus?
    
    
        No, it's not that I take any issue with such. I merely thought that it would be connected in some way to our in-school activities.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        That was a curious matter to me as well. Our recent requests have primarily been from ES, so...?
    
  
        Hm? It's quite hard to explain, so you’d like us to follow you to the location itself? I see.
    
  
        Are you alright with that, Mayoi-dono?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        E-Eep. To not know any of the details is exceedingly scary...
    
    
        But I understand. I'll follow your lead. 
    Through fire, through water, until the ends of the Earth...!
    


Location: Dead End Café





    
    Shinobu
    
        This is...?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Err, Miss Producer, what is a "Dead End Café"?
    I understand what cafés are, but not a "dead end" one... Do you think we will be able to serve p-poisoned coffee?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        You never told us that we would be serving poisoned food, Anzu-dono! That is so unpleasant, as the Ninja Association is a wholesome group!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha, you're overthinking it.
    





    
    Shinobu
    
        Ooh...? What brings you here, Mashiro-dono?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        That's my line, Sengoku~ Did Dead End Café reach out to you guys too?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Correct. To be precise, we were referred by Anzu-dono. Did she do the same to you?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah, the Drama Club's also referred by her. These costumes make it the perfect job for us, y'know?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        It truly suits you all, as always~
    
    
        Then, why are you wearing a costume at a café...?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Haha, I'm not so sure about that either.
    Well, the café's theme is something like: a girl wanders into the underworld, where dead servers entertain and cook for her.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hmm, so that is what's popular as of late... Were you aware of such a thing, Mayoi-dono?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        No, I'm not familiar with the trends... But that is a unique theme.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        It really is—Ayase-senpai? You were up early today, but I didn't expect to see you here.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        You were offered the same job too, M-Mashiro-san?
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Hm? Do you two know each other?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Yes. Everyone in ALKALOID transferred dorms after MDM. Mashiro-san and I have been roommates since then.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Fair enough. You have a surprisingly close friend there.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        N-No, we're not that close! I tend to be extremely shy; therefore, I'm not really familiar with him!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. Please don't be modest. I'm younger than you, so I don't care if you're casual with me, okay?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I-I'm formal by default so it's alright!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. Either way, it's still nice to have someone to talk to.
    Anzu-san, you referred both the Drama Club and the Ninja Association here because of our connection to Yumenosaki, right?
    
    
        I see. So Dead End Café is run by a fellow student's parents.
    We were referred because you heard that our club activities were going well, huh...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        We're under an entertainment agency for the time being. Thus, requesting jobs up-front goes against my moral code...
    
  
        Actually, there doesn't seem to be anyone else from the Drama Club here—
    
  
        Huh? There's something on the ceiling...!
    





    
    Wataru
    
        Ghehe. You have finally noticed me♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
     Eeeek! A-An Eccentric...!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Whoaaa!? H-H-How the hell were you able to stick onto the ceiling, Hibiki-senpai!?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehe, you're too naïve, Tomoya-kun! Since I'm an entertainer, I always have to look for ways to make an amazing entrance☆
    
  
    Now, allow me to properly introduce myself. It has been quite a while, Miss Anzu. I am your Wataru Hibiki...☆
    It appears that there are others with you too. Let us all work hard today!
  



    
    Mayoi
    
     Aaaaaaiiiiiieeeeee!
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Don't be so nervous, Mayoi-dono.
    
    
        There's no need to be so scared of him. How he behaves may be a bit strange, but the Three Eccentrics—including Shinkai-dono—are all charming people.

10 minutes later



    
    Wataru
    
        Alright, are the two from the Ninja Association finished changing?
    
  
        The grand opening event is soon, so apply your makeup quickly. If you're having trouble, I am willing to be of assistance♪
    I have plenty of experience as an actor, you know. So I can assist with your makeup...♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Nah, you can't just do makeup—you can do pretty much anything.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        I can't just do "anything"! For example, if I were thrown into a blast furnace, even I could only give a thumbs up before sinking.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        That's such a weird scenario, though?
    
  
        Anyways... Don't be afraid to let me know if you're having trouble, Sengoku.
    





    
    Shinobu
    
        Much obliged. Can you check if I have any stains on the back of my jacket, then?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ah. If I coul—
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Oh my. It's quite rude to interrupt two friends talking, Mister Phantom.
    Let us leave them to themselves and talk about love! I have a feeling you and I are birds of a feather♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Um... Huh...?
    
  
        (Scary! I don't get along too well with this person, but he keeps insisting on getting closer to me?)
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Tehehe. Please don't be afraid! As you are the phantom and I am the clown, don't we both wear a mask?
    





    
    Mayoi
    
        W-Where on earth did that pigeon come from...!?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        There aren't any tricks or gimmicks around here, tehe♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Hey, what are you two doing? It's almost time for the grand opening, so please stop fooling around!
    Especially you, Hibiki-senpai! You're only here because Hokuto-senpai couldn't make it! Control yourself!
    You became a full-fledged member of society a long time ago. The academy clearly doesn't have your back anymore.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Ah, the good ol' scolding...☆ However, the real world is far more selective than a school packed with a wide variety of people.
    Even impudent behavior can be shadowed with an impudent environment. That is particularly true in show business—a place out of the ordinary.
    
  
        In retrospect, aren't you still the same old Tomoya-kun? And I don't mean that in a bad way!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You threw that at me so casually... I'm hurt.
    
  
        I mean, just because you said it wasn't "in a bad way" doesn't mean you can just go say whatever the hell you please!
      Like, I was always told that I'm too "normal" since childhood. Poppin' Party[1] would never happen if I was the same as before.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        That's wonderful. You are raising the standards of what's "normal" in your own way~ It's a different approach from merely excelling in a single area, and I think it's commendable.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Whatever you just said pisses me off... But that's just who you are.
    
  
        Sorry for getting carried away, Sengoku. You don't have any stains on your jacket from what I see.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        That's a relief to hear. I finished applying my makeup, so I am all geared up.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ooh, you're pretty good at this.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ryuseitai has done a lot of work in small venues, so I'm rather skilled at getting myself ready.
    Though, I cannot cross-dress, unlike you all in the Drama Club.
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        I-I'm also done.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        You are all amazing at this! We must make haste now, Miss Anzu is waiting for us.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Oh, shoot. Is it almost time?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        I hear people discussing the sorts of routines we'll do over there.
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        "Routines"...?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Correct. Since we are servers, there is practically no need for us to cook. One of those routines appears to be writing with white sauce[2] in front of the customers.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        It's like what maid cafés do, right? Where they go "moe moe kyun☆" while drawing hearts with ketchup?[3]
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Heheh. Good guess, Tomoya-kun! It's exactly what you say it is!
    As idols and actors, we are sure to be beautiful, graceful, and sometimes adorable! I am certain the customers will be pleased♪
    
  
        To show the others an example, please write "LOVE" in extra-large letters on my omurice...☆
    





    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. This is Dead End Café, so I'll be drawing a skull instead. Is that alright with you? ♪
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Oh my, even how you treat your superiors has changed~ Good grief, who taught you these manners?
    



    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ "Poppin' Party" is the name of Nazuna's welcome back concert that took place in High Five! A pretty significant event for Tomoya, especially since he's performing in it as Ra*bits' new leader.
    
    
        ↑ Also known as béchamel sauce. Often used in omurice, but not really to "write with" unlike ketchup...
    
    
        ↑ "Moe moe kyun" is an incantation to make food taste delicious. It can be localized as "abracadabra" or "bibbidi bobbidi boo," but they don't give the same cutesy vibe. Popularized by K-On!

Season: SummerLocation: Dead End Café




Sometime after the café has opened



    
    Shinobu
    
        Welcome~♪
    Here is your seat, milord. I shall deliver you the menu posthaste!
    
  
    Ah, do pardon me. I lived and died as a ninja. Thus, I unintentionally slip back into my previous way of speaking at times.
  
  
    Right then, I shall be off!
  
  
    Whew... Being both a ninja and a butler is a bit tricky, isn't it?
  
  
    It is also much busier than I was expecting. Is that causing you anxiety, Mayoi-dono?
  



    
    Mayoi
    
        ......
    





    
    Shinobu
    
        Alas, it seems I was correct! You appear quite down, Mayoi-dono! Are you alright?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ......
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Mayoi-dono...?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        Ah, my apologies... The manager told me I'm "really as silent as the dead!" so I've been staring at the floor and making not a single peep, but...
    
  
        Urgh... Is this really okay? Rather, I feel like it gives a strange impression that customers would be more pleased if I acted coldly.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ahaha. This kind of role does fit you though, Ayase-senpai. Plus, it balances out with our noisy coworker, so it's fine. You know who I mean, the dead ex-clown—
    





    
    Wataru
    
        Amazing! ☆ It has been a long time since I had contact with the living~
    Were you lured to the underworld by your desire to seek pleasure?
    
  
        I, a failed street performer during my lifetime, have no need to worry about struggling with poverty or how others rate me here!
    We have an eternity! I shall be here for eternity!
    
  
        Hehehe. And when one is trapped in eternity, their conversations do tend to eternally meander. Now then, would you like to order? ☆
    Hm? What do I recommend from the menu?
    
  
        Let's see... If you wish, I could draw a portrait of you with our special sauce!
    I have also long been able to write using grains of rice; detail work is my forte!
    I'm dead, so I can illustrate as many dishes as you wish♪ Afflictions such as fatigue and the cold do not affect me any longer! ♪
    
  
        I see! Two Dead Omurice, coming right up~♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Man, you can tell how damn loud he is just by looking at him.
    
  
        But because he stands out so much, we're going viral on social media.
    There might be an even bigger crowd in the afternoon since he's a special guest for today.
    





    
    Mayoi
    
        E-Even bigger...!? Just the thought of it makes me dizzy...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Keep yourself together~ There were far more people in the audience during MDM, so there's no need to be frightened.
    
  
        Oh? Anzu-dono is watching us from the kitchen and smiling.
    
  
        Alright! At this pace, we will become a Ninja Club in a single bound! Let us do our very best!
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        U-Um. Chief...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        There is nothing to worry about. You are doing just fine as you are right now, Mayoi-dono♪
    Your outfit suits you well, and when you take up a silent character, the charm of your handsome features only doubles♪
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        T-Thank you very much...
    



    
    Shinobu
    
        Ah, yes. A new order has come in? I shall excuse myself here, then!
    
  
        Oh, this manner of speech? I lived out my days as a ninja, see—
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ......
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Mister Phantom. You look so miserable that one would think you've fallen into despair. Are you getting into character?
    Hehehe. If so, you've nailed it♪
    
  
        While I am butting into your affairs a bit, won't you listen to the tale I have to tell? It is the way of life for both clowns and actors to perfectly pull off their given roles.
    Play your desired role as how others desire it to be. If you do not, you will bring about complaints that you are "boring," that the audience was "let down"... That is the sad fate of a clown like myself.
    
  
        All humans want to be loved. When a clown is loved, it keeps their art alive. For me, that brings both hope and a feeling of resignation.
    But even having said that, you don't need to go beyond your limits to stand on stage. Those who work behind the scenes have their own happiness.
    
  
        Mister Phantom. While I've been observing you, you've nearly stumbled about two or three times—are you feeling alright?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ...I'm alright. You don't have to worry about that.
    



    
    Wataru
  
        Hm. I see! Do pardon me for sticking my nose where it doesn't belong~☆
    
  
        Tehehe. We have spoken for too long. I tend to get quite in-character for all of my roles.
    I won't be able to write letters on as many omurice as I need to like this.
    
  
        I can handle the customers myself, so... Go help out in the kitchen, if you would please?
    



    
    Mayoi
    
        ...Understood.
    
    
        ......
    
    
        (You were probably aiming your words at me rather than just telling a story about yourself, weren't you? Hibiki-san.)
        (It's just as you say. I can't become someone like you Eccentrics and the myriad of other geniuses that exist in this world. Anyone having expectations for me is incredibly frightening.)
    
    
        (Because I am a "phantom"—a trivial, hideous existence compared to yours.)
        (I suppose it's a beautiful thing, to play the role you've been called upon to play. But for me...that's too heavy of a burden.)
    
    
        (It may not be the right way to say this, but... Even if it disappoints someone, I don't want to hurt those who love me—)
        (Because I'm a weak, pitiful existence that can't fulfill the role others want me to play.)

Season: SummerLocation: Saison Avenue




One hour later



    
    Shinobu
    
        He isn't here either... Just where on earth did Mayoi-dono disappear to?
    Anzu-dono, did you spot him on your end?
    
    
        Hm, so you caught neither hide nor hair of him. That's a problem... Mayoi-dono is very good at hiding, which can make it quite difficult for anyone searching for him.
    
    
        Oh, why are you pulling out your phone, Anzu-dono? Do you have some kind of secret strategy?
    I see... Since he's still wearing Dead End Café's uniform, perhaps people will be talking about it on social media?
    
    
        Interesting, this method didn't cross my mind at all!
    I am impressed indeed, Anzu-dono. I was so flustered that such an idea hadn't occurred to me.
    
    
        Alright, I'll do some searching on my phone as well!
    Keyword, keyword... Would something like "ALKALOID" work?
    
    
        Hmmm... I'm not seeing anything. I suppose it isn't that easy. I'll try a different word...
    
    
        Oh? Did you find something, Anzu-dono?
    
    
        Oho... So you found something via a person who mentioned the department store on Saison Avenue. This photo...is certainly of Mayoi-dono, isn't it?
    
    
        Hm...? Why is he curled up on a bench? How strange.
    
    
        No, it won't do any good to make assumptions from the photo. I would like to ask Mayoi-dono himself for details. Let us head to the location in the photo immediately.
    
    
        That was an impressive feat, Anzu-dono. Perhaps it's much like the old saying: "If you want to hide a tree, hide it within a forest"... And if you want to hide a person, do so within a crowd.
        I have just noticed the multitude of "eyes"—phone cameras—pointed at him.
    
    
        It would be good if Mayoi-dono is unharmed despite all the gazes upon him, but...for some reason, I am incredibly concerned.
    


Location: Dead End Café





    
    Tomoya
    
        Welcome~♪
    Yes, the restaurant is full right now. Please put your name on the waiting list, and we'll call you when a table is available.
    
    
        "How long will it take"? Umm, I'd say around 30 minutes. Sorry to keep you waiting.
    
    
        (This is bad... It's impossible to keep up with everything when two of our servers are away...)
    (I wonder if Hibiki-senpai could do something about this situation...?)
    



    
    Wataru
    
        (Whispering) Tomoya-kun, Tomoya-kun.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah, what is it, Hibiki-senpai?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        I suddenly felt like starting a show. Would you be willing to be my assistant?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Hah? Just when I thought you'd say that...
    
    
        Generally speaking, if you were to do that, the table turnover would decrease.
        The people waiting in the front would get mad and start filing complaints.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        That is precisely why I want to do it, Tomoya-kun! Please think for yourself rather than use common sense. Now, take a close look around the café...☆
        At present, all of the seats are taken. However, there are plenty of seats available on the floor.
        Those who are still waiting will be sitting on the floor for the show.
    
    
        If Sengoku-kun returns with Mister Phantom in the meantime, then this whole situation will be solved. Why don't we bet on that possibility?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Eh? Well, it is possible in theory. But...
    



    
    Wataru
    
        "But"? Don't tell me that you're thinking of what is going to happen if we fail, Tomoya-kun?
    
    
        It would be out of character if I show off too much, but I am the best when it comes to dexterity. I'm one of the Five Eccentrics, Wataru Hibiki, remember?
        I shall perform for not 30 minutes, but an hour—no, I could do this for eternity!
        Rest assured, there is no amount of amazing that will cause the customers to miss the last train♪
    





    
    Wataru
    
        Or were you thinking that Miss Anzu and the rest won't return? Oh dear, I don't recall raising such a heartless child.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Since when did I ever see you as my foster dad!?
    
    
        ...Fine. Whatever. I'll go along with your plans, if you insist.
        After all, I believe that they'll come back as well.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Splendid! I knew you would say that♪
        Now then, Tomoya-kun, please let everyone in at once! It's showtime! ♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        God, you truly are a natural-born entertainer, huh?
    
    
        Go break a leg, Hibiki-senpai! You better apologize if this show of yours fails!
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Hehehe. If it comes down to that, you are free to do whatever you please with me. I would be dead before I could sweep any mistake under the rug...
        Actually, I'm already dead right now! ♪
    
    
        Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls—come one, come all! The dead man's act is about to begin! All payments shall be done at later time♪
        Welcome to Dead End Café's surprise grand opening show! This is your passerby performer, Wataru Hibiki, reporting in...☆

The next day, after school



    
    Mika
    
        (Haaah... This ain't any good. 'M not gettin' anywhere...)
        (I couldn't finish the new outfits in time, so we gotta settle with our usual ones fer tomorrow's live.)
        (Even though it's gonna be Oshi-san's last performance as part of Valkyrie an' all...)
    
    
        (But I reckon it's fine, though Oshi-san used to hate havin' to wear the same outfit over 'n over again.)
        (We've been short on money for a lotta reasons, so this ain't nothin' new.)
        (Those outfits're the first thing to come to mind when people think of Valkyrie... The fans'll probably be real happy to see 'em.)
        (They're better than the crappy ones I made, anyways.)
    
    
        (Valkyrie'll come to an end without mixin' in nothing unnecessary, maintainin' the essence of Oshi-san's style all the while.)
        (And that's alright. It's a happy ending... We managed t'make it this far, despite havin' hit rock bottom before.)
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Huh? Heeey, Kagehira-senpai! Were you just about to leave?
    





    
    Mika
    
        Ngah? We've been seein' each other a real lot lately, Tomoya-kun. Whatcha doin' here? This place's pretty far from school.
        The apartment I'll be movin' into in spring's nearby, so I was just checkin' this place out.
        I've been puttin' it off 'til now, but I figured it's 'bout time to start pickin' out furniture.
    





    
    Tomoya
    
        Ohh, is that so... I'm just a regular shopper~ My family comes to this mall every once in a while.
        We just finished buying everything we need, so I'm carrying our stuff to the car.
    



    
    Mika
    
        I see... Ya sure have a lotta bags to carry there.
    





    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah... Ah! Wait, I didn't buy this plush for myself, okay?! My little sister's just a big fan of President Hibiki...!
    



    
    Mika
    
        Ahaha, nobody's askin' 'bout that. Ain't it fine, though? Just buy whatever ya like.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ugh... We tend to get too excited in places like this and end up buying lots of unnecessary things.
        The word "sale" is my family's biggest weakness!
    



    
    Mika
    
        Ah, right. Ya did say yer with yer family. Where're they, anyways?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Ah, I think they're looking at the store over there. Can you see them?
    



    
    Mika
    
        Hm...? Sorry, I don't think I do.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yep... We're all "normal," so we blend right into the crowd.
        It's not the best trait to have as an idol... I envy you, Kagehira-senpai. People have been staring and whispering things about you for quite some time.
    



    
    Mika
    
        Eh? Oh, yer right. There're some kids pointin' 'n squealin' over there.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        You just noticed that?
    



    
    Mika
    
        Yeah, I was real deep in thought. Agh, I don't like bein' stared at...
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I heard Valkyrie's really popular lately, so you're becoming more famous day by day.
        If you're not in disguise, you'll cause an uproar in places like this.
        You already stand out quite a lot as is.
    



    
    Mika
    
        Err, ya think so? My mismatched eyes really are weird, huh?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        No, that's not it. It's more like, your eyes are very attractive... Even though I'm a guy, I find you really good-looking! I get the chills every time I watch you perform!
        If I were a girl, I'd fall in love with you the moment you start singing!
    



    
    Mika
    
        Whatcha mean by that...? Wait, ya watch our lives? Thank ya kindly~♪
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah, I've been keeping an eye on you guys for quite a while now. Though, you two only ever pay attention to Nii~chan, I think.
        But Valkyrie's still our number one enemy—a wall we absolutely have to climb over.
        There's no way we'd let ourselves be defeated. No, not just that—I want to make sure that Ra*bits is better than Valkyrie before Nii~chan graduates.
    



    
    Mika
    
        ...Ngah?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        We have to! Otherwise, it'll seem like Nii~chan transferring from Valkyrie to Ra*bits was a mistake, right?
        He's always been working so desperately. All the hardships he's gone through in the course of this year... I don't want him to think of it as a waste of time.
    
    
        Sorry to keep talking on and on by myself. But ultimately, that's why...
        In the end, we, Ra*bits, are going to beat Valkyrie one-on-one. At least once.
        The Repayment Festival is our last chance we have left to do this...
        I don't know if you guys are performing or not, but it would be great if we can have a showdown there.
        If you are, please don't go easy on us.
    



    
    Mika
    
        ...Ya think y'can beat us? Even though yer nothin' but cute lil' bunnies?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        But we're the very bunnies Nii~chan trained for a whole year.
    
    
        Oh shoot, my family finished shopping before I realized. They're leaving without me, so I have to go now!
    





    
    Mika
    
        Hey, wait! We ain't performin' in—
    
    
        (...Aaand there he goes. Reckon I'll bump into others if I chase him in this crowd.)
        (He sure is quick as a bunny~)
    
    
        (What was that anyways? Was he tryin' to pick a fight?)
        ("Ra*bits beating Valkyrie"? Now that's a first. There ain't no way that can happen, yeah? Not when Valkyrie—Oshi-san's the strongest! He's invincible!)
    
    
        (That's how things should be, but... Honestly, I got a lil' bit scared there...)

    <content><![CDATA[Wow. Wataru? Being a proper senpai? It&#39;s more likely than you think.
Phantom Thieves VS Detectives is so dear to me—it&#39;s still my favorite event story so far, even after four years. I was able to get permission to TLC this chapter. There&#39;s quite a lot of major changes to it, but I had fun!

Season: WinterLocation: Museum-like Stage





    
    Tomoya
    
        One, two, three, four! Hop, hop, hop♪
        ...Alright, that's perfect. Tomoya Mashiro has made a full recovery♪
    
    
        (Ra*bits were lucky enough to be the main act for today's live...)
        (I gave it my all in order to keep up with everyone else, but I couldn't show off my strengths.)
    
    
        (Hajime and Mitsuru are improving at such an incredible rate. They always had more potential than me since the very beginning.)
        (I was on break for only a few days, but it's like I've already been left behind.)
    
    
        (I also need to work harder.)
        (The Mystery Stage just reached its turning point. Sena-senpai also said that the "riddles" after today will be even more troublesome.)
        (I don't know if we can successfully crack them like today.)
    
    
        (I need to be prepared for them by the next time we're the main act so that I can show-off myself. Nothing will be lost that way.)
        (I have to fight tooth and nail. But I can't become an idol all by myself.)
    
    
        (In order to take everyone's hands and move forward, I must go the extra mile.)
        (I would be a burden to others if I don't. No... It's because I continue standing on the same stage with everyone.)
    
    
        (I can do it~ I'll stay after practice for a bit♪)
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Are there any naughty children here~? What a pity, there's only an average child☆
    





    
    Tomoya
    
        That scared me?! Woah, the Masked Pervert appeared!
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Ahaha. Tomoya-kun's reactions are amusing as usual. It has a rather shocked value to it, hehehe!
        How are you? You won't faint, correct?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        I'm not that scared... What, wouldn't you typically shout "Are you surprised? You're surprised, aren't you! How amazing! ☆" with such glee?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Tomoya-kun really can't imitate me well...
        I am much more refined than that! My grace shines through even when I'm spouting nonsense, right?
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Go look at a mirror.
        Uwah, on closer inspection, you're wearing some weird costume.
        You're not even participating in the Mystery Stage, so why are you dressed up as a phantom thief?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        No, I was thinking of adding something amazing into the mix if the whole unfolding felt boring.
        So I made a variety of arrangements, and I'm wearing one right now as a test.
        Though, looking at everything that has happened, it looks like my turn will never come.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Yeah, I never thought you'd show up... Err, do you need something from me?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        No? I already said that I would stay behind the scenes. I'm here to clean up after the Mystery Stage is over because this auditorium will be used for class tomorrow.
        Cleaning it up everyday...
        And set everything back up before the show begins. It relies on physical strength more, so I couldn't ask Miss Anzu to come and help.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        So it's like that, how tiring... Would it be better if I came and helped out?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        No, no. I already feel like lecturing you for staying back to practice. It wouldn't be my problem if you push yourself too hard that you faint again.
        Please leave this kind of work to the backstage staff. You should go home immediately and get a good night's sleep to eliminate your fatigue.
        Living life in the fast lane won't do any good. I know you can't curb your enthusiasm, but being idle is part of our jobs as idols.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        ...You saying such wise words[1] feels out of place.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        How painful. I always gave you advice in hopes of happy growth and even taught you with such care!
        Aaah! This unrequited love is a tragedy that would render even Shakespeare speechless with shock!
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Uhm... You're always helping me improve, even if you are an absolute nutjob.
        But to be honest, I can't really keep up with your footsteps...
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Indeed. What is truly a pity is that you're not Wataru Hibiki. I have forgotten about that and regret it greatly.
        However, I shall forget about that in the blink of an eye tomorrow☆
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Please keep it in mind a bit longer. Seriously, you're always saying such careless things...
        I still want to practice some more. I don't want to get in your way, so is it fine if I dance here?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Sure. Don't mind me, do as you wish. However, if you mess anything up, I'll use a roundhouse kick to stop you.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Can you be a little more gentle? That roundhouse kick will kill someone. I'm still recovering, so please be careful with me~
    



    
    Wataru
    
        What a spoiled child you are.
        Well, don't fret about it. I might have ran into you by chance...
    
    
        But I won't get any closer, since I wouldn't want to hurt you again.
        I shall leave right after I've finished cleaning up, so please pretend I'm not here.
        I am quite inconsiderate and can only protect you by staying away.
    





    
    Tomoya
    
        Is that so? Then why did you watch today's show despite saying you'd "stay away" from me?
        You were sitting in Row D, Seat 23, right?
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Oops, I've been found out. My disguise should have been perfect.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Too perfect that it's unnatural.
        The one most unlike you in today's audience was the guy sitting in Row D, Seat 23.
        He was at our S3 too...
    
    
        Speaking of which, that guy was always around. You've been watching over me the whole time, huh? I didn't expect you to worry that much.
    



    
    Wataru
    
        Oh, oh... How embarrassing. This is Wataru Hibiki's greatest mistake.
        Thinking that someone as clueless Tomoya-kun would never see through my disguise, I slacked off, only to fail in the end.
    



    
    Tomoya
    
        Are you trying to piss me off?
    



Translation Notes
    
        ↑ Localized from "先輩らしいこと" (senpai-like things). Wataru doesn't act like a "proper" senpai most of the time, which is why Tomoya felt off. The relationship between senpai and kouhai is quite important. Adding to that, kouhai usually talk to their senpai using honorific speech, but Tomoya often drops his formalities when talking to Wataru.

Series: Ensemble Stars!!Writer: AkiraCharacters: Anzu, Tomoya MashiroTLC: convex#3440QCs: Meru, Sheep





Season: SpringLocation: Dance Studio






    
    Tomoya
    
        "Come now, everyone! Take a look and laugh!"
        "I am a clown who seeks to spread laughter through silly antics!"
        "Feel free to spit and throw rocks at me to cast away your daily sorrows! ♪"
    
    
        (Ugh... That came out differently than I'd expected.)
    
    
        (What am I doing wrong? I can't get into my role!)
        (They told me that it would be a bit more challenging this time, but I should've learned some techniques from last year...)
    
    
        (I stumble the moment I step out of my comfort zone. What am I supposed to do? I wish I was better at applying my skills into new roles—)
    





    
    Tomoya
    
        Eek!
    
    
        Ah, you scared me! D-Do you need something, Producer? Man, with all that clapping out of nowhere, I thought you were a ghost!
    
    
        You sure have a quiet presence... Oh, hold on. Is my time in the dance studio up?
        So you're here to tell me to leave?
    
    
        I'm sorry! I was actually practicing with everyone else in Ra*bits, but Hajime and Mitsuru had to do work of their own. That's why I'm here alone.
        There was some time left in the booking, so I thought I might as well do some rehearsal by myself!
        I couldn't practice my part for Ra*bits since I wanted the others to keep pace.
    
    
        Shit, I was so caught up in rehearsing that I lost track of time! I'll pack up and leave right away—
    
    
        Woah?!
    
    
        Ahaha. Guess I tripped...♪
    
    
        You were laughing just now huh, Producer? Oh no, I'm not saying that was rude.
        That laugh! That's the exact reaction I wanted out of my audience! Um, could you tell me what was so funny about what I just did?
    
    
        Oh, I'm being too pushy? Sorry, I was in a rush...
    
    
        You see, I'm starting to get some real acting jobs. The role I got cast for this time is a bit challenging...
    
    
        Sigh, this all started because I've been in the Drama Club for quite a while. During one of the performances I was in, someone took notice and scouted me.
        That gave me an opportunity to be in movies and theatricals, though they were all supporting roles.
    
    
        It's quite rare for someone to act well despite looking like a child nowadays.
        I've been taking advantage of this feature of mine here and there.
        When people think of child actors, they think of me, Tomoya Mashiro! ...That's the kind of reputation I have at this point, more or less.
    
    
        But I'm already a second year! I'm not sure how to feel about being considered a "child actor"...
        Well, I'm happy to get the roles either way. I do love acting, after all.
        Plus, Ra*bits is struggling a bit right now with how we have to do solo gigs on the side to get by.
    
    
        It's the same for Nii-chan, who's already gone off to college. Each of us has to improve our own skills to gain individual popularity.
        By doing so, we can draw attention to the unit.
        That's why I want to make a name for myself as an actor.
    
    
        However, I want to be noticed as an idol and for Ra*bits.
        Our agency, Rhythm Link, is well-known and has a long history. It's pretty hard to stand out.
        These guys tend to prioritize seniority over merit, so the people who've been here for a long time take all the high-profile jobs.
        We rarely get any worthwhile opportunities.
    
    
        Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm not criticizing the agency.
        That's one reason why we chose to be in Rhythm Link. Their status and long history can be beneficial to us!
    
    
        Anyways... Umm, what was I talking about again? I always lose myself when I get too excited.
    
    
        Where was I? Well, I was given the chance to perform with a fairly renowned theater company.
        I was cast as a little clown or, to be more precise, a mischievous fairy.
    
    
        Yep, it's similar to Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream. I play a trickster who skips across the stage and causes trouble.
        The role reminded me of two guys I look up to, so I was really motivated!
    
    
        Yet I wasn't able to pull it off... Back at my school's Drama Club, I only played as princes and princesses. I'd over-exaggerate my parts no matter what I do.
        I don't have to ask anyone to tell nobody's going to find my performance entertaining as is.
        I was too stiff, let alone playful. So the feeling of a mischievous fairy didn't come across at all.
    
    
        Huh? I should mimic Ra*bits' behavior instead?
        Sure, I guess we get treated like fairies sometimes.
    
    
        But our behavior typically resembles what good kids do. My role requires pulling pranks and having a sharp tongue, so I don't think that fits...
        If I emphasize Ra*bits too much, I would tarnish our pure and innocent image.
        Maybe people will grow tired of us if we just stick to being good kids.
    
    
        However, that's only the brand we made for Ra*bits.
        I want to keep that image. I know I'm trying to eat my cake and have it too...
    





    
    Tomoya
    
        But a true actor—a true idol—makes the impossible possible and turns dreams into reality. That is who I, Tomoya Mashiro, aspire to be.
    



CommentsThe lines Tomoya acted out in the first three lines seem to reference what Wataru said in Transparency and Masks...?

Come, curse me. Throw stones at this lying coward... Please, spit at and kick this horrible imposter who plays with people&#39;s hearts.

Translation Notes
    
        卯の花 (unohana) is a pseudonym for Deutzia crenata, a white flowering shrub native to (and common in) Japan. The "卯" in the name refers to the fourth Chinese zodiac, the rabbit, due to the flowers blooming in April. Its other name, ウツギ/空木 (utsugi), comes from its hollow stems. 空木 means "empty shrub" literally.

    Emu
    
        Alright! Good work today, everyone!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Yeah, see you tomorrow!
    



    
    Rui
    
        Good work today.
    



    
    Nene
    
        Good work.
    
  
        ......
    
  
        (Everyone went home already, but I still want to practice a bit more.)
    
  
        U-Umph!
    



    
    NeneRobo
  
        ......
    



    
    Nene
    
        You're the audience today, NeneRobo, so...
        Please watch me sing.
    



    
    NeneRobo
  
        ......
    



    
    Nene
    
        —♪
    
  
    (It's alright. I'm able to sing on stage.)
    (But...)
    
  
        (I wonder if I'm able to sing the same way in front of an audience.)
    (What if I mess up again...?)
    
  
        Whew...
    
  
        Thank you all for listening.
    
  
        I can finally stand on stage by myself.
    But I think this was all thanks to NeneRobo being there for me.
    
  
        I guess that's why I'd get scared every time I got near the stage...
    Because you weren't there with me.
    



    
    Rui
    
        ......I see, I see.
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Eep!?
    



    
    Rui
    
        So that's the reason why you kept bringing her around, even though she already finished her job.
    



    
    Nene
    
        W-Where the hell did you come from...?
    



    
    Rui
    
        Hehe.
        I just happened to be here, so it's the perfect time to make the "surprise visit" trope a reality.
    



    
    Nene
    
        The hell?
    



    
    Rui
    
        Now, now.
    Apologizes that it seemed like I was eavesdropping.
    
  
        I have a present for you, see?
    Your favorite grapefruit juice!
    



    
    Nene
    
        Are you trying to fool me now?
    



    
    Rui
    
        Heheheh, I suppose you could say that.
    
  
        However...
    
  
        Despite not using her on stage anymore, it looks like you're taking good care of NeneRobo.
    



    
    Nene
  
        ......
    



    
    Rui
    
        It's safe to say that this robot completed her role and fulfilled your dream.
    
  
        But she's not leaving the stage as long as she's needed.
    



    
    Nene
  
        What do you mean by that?
    



    
    Rui
    
        I have a proposal.
    Will you allow me to keep this robot for a while?
    



    
    Nene
  
        Huh? Are you gonna remodel it?
    



    
    Rui
    
        I would never do that.
    Rather, I'm going to add some improvements to her.
    



    
    Nene
  
        "Improvements"...?
    



    
    Rui
    
        She's a very high performing robot.
    I'll think of ways to make her more user friendly.
    
  
        That way, you'll have full control of her and can stand on stage together.
    



    
    Nene
  
        You're alright with that?
    



    
    Rui
    
        Of course.
    It's a director's responsibility to lend an ear to their performers.
    



    
    Nene
  
        ...Mhm.
    
  
        But if you add anything weird, I'll get pissed. Got it?

Location: Phoenix Wonderland - Wonder Stage





    
    Tsukasa
    
        With that, the meeting is now in session!
    
    
        I want to add some novel, never-before-seen acts in our upcoming show.
        Give me some ideas on what you'd like to see in it!
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Uhm.
    



    
    Emu
    
        Oh, oh! I got one!
        We can all start flying across the sky!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Hmm... Well, it's pretty flashy, but it's not original at all!
        Step it up a notch!
    



    
    Emu
    
        We could all explode then!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        How is exploding supposed to help us!?
    



    
    Emu
    
        Going "KABOOM!" is undoubtedly really flashy and striking!
        We could use something like colored smoke!
    
    
        Oh! And I'll be red!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Hold on, I'm supposed to be red!
        Leaders have been associated with red since ancient times!
    
    
        However, if the smoke is too flashy, the audience wouldn't be able to see the stage...
        Your idea has been rejected—once again!
    
    
        Who else would like to share?
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...I hav—
    



    
    Emu
    
        I got another!
        Let's just explode without the smoke!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Enough with the explosions!
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Could you ple—
    



    
    Rui
    
        Everyone, it appears that Nene has an ingenious idea.
    



    
    Emu
    
        M-Mmph!?
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        (Did that guy just shove a donut right into Emu's mouth at lightning speed!?)
    



    
    Emu
    
        M-Mmmph...? Nom nom nom...
    



    
    Rui
    
        Your turn, Nene.
    



    
    Nene
    
        (That was so unnecessary.)
    
    
        Rui's been adding some improvements to NeneRobo...
    
    
        So that we can both stand on stage together...
    
    
        (Tsukasa would much rather be the one in the spotlight instead of a robot, so I doubt he'll agree. But...)
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        NeneRobo, huh? Right.
        What kind of acts will it do?
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Eh?
    
    
        (Wait, that's a good reaction... I think.)
    
    
        Err... Um...
        That'll depend on what Rui's adding in.
    



    
    Rui
    
        Well, then. How about this?
        First, we'll have her go onstage by herself...
    





    
    Emu
    
        I see, I see! How interestin'!
        I'll sink about it!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Don't you mean "think"!?
    
    
        Regardless, this is a never-before-seen act.
        You got my seal of approval!
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...I'm glad.
    



    
    Emu
    
        I wonder what kind of things NeneRobo-chan can do? This'll be fun!
    



    
    Rui
    
        Surely. Do look forward to it.
    



    
    Nene
    
        ...Mm.
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        In any respect, I shall always be the star of the stage, no matter what improvements were made!
    



    
    Nene
    
        Shut up, Flopstar.
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        F-Flop!?
    



    
    Emu
    
        "Flop"...? Okay, you'll be Mister Flala today!
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Why me!?
    



    
    Rui
    
        It's such a syncopated name though, Mister Flala.
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Y-You all better stop!
        Do not give me a foolish, unrefined nickname!
    



    
    Nene
    
        But Flala, you aren't foolish; you are a fool.
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Why y—on top of calling me a fool, you even removed the "mister"!
    



    
    Emu
    
        Flala-flala, lop-lop, fla-la-la-lop~♪
    



    
    Tsukasa
    
        Stop, stooop!
        Don't you dare make it into an arcane song and dance to ittttt!
    



    
    Nene
    
        ......Heh.
