# There's No Way I Can Admit It (Day 5)

**Teru:** Ow ow ow ow...! That huuurt...

**Tsubasa:** What's wrong, Teru-san? Did you get injured somewhere?

**Teru:** Nah, it just hurts if I press down on my skin here. I think it's a pressure point.

Hey, Sakuraba. Do you know which body part this pressure point connects to?

**Kaoru:** Dunno. It's probably a stupid one since it's you.

**Teru:** What!? Hmm... If it's gonna be like that, I wonder how *you'll* react.

If you feel pain when I press here, then it means you're also stupid! Take that!

**Kaoru:** I-It doesn't hurt... I really don't feel any pain... I'm fine! Let me go at once...!

**Teru:** Wow, seriously hiding the paiâ€”

Oww!? S-Stop! Sakuraba!

**Tsubasa:** I guess it hurts just a bit... I wonder which pressure point it is? I'm curious.
