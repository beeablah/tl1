# [Mini Talk] Tomoya Mashiro: Cinderellaesque

### 1/3

**Tomoya:** "G-Good mornin', Stepmother."

Ugh... That came out stiff, huh.

"Good morning, Stepmother." Alright, now *that's* more like Cinderella...♪

> Nope. Not even close. Shall I show you an example of how to do it?

Possibility 1
> **Tomoya:** Alright, sur— Wait, why are you acting all excited before I finished my sentence?!
>
> Well, you *are* the club president after all.
>
> So of *course* you can act Cinderella better than me. I'm still learning, y'know.

Possibility 2
> **Tomoya:** S-Sure...
>
> What, I'm too straightforward? And you're a good-for-nothing pervert.
>
> I have little confidence in my acting, y'know?

> "Morning, Cinderella."

Possibility 1
> **Tomoya:** Woah, it's the Masked Pervert— I-I mean, Stepmother.
>
> Yeah, yeah. I know, the show starts soon.
>
> I gotta play Cinderella perfectly.

Possibility 2
> **Tomoya:** What was that for?! It's not morning anymore...
>
> Huh? ...Ah, so you were replying as the Stepmother.
>
> Ughh~ I can't get into my role at all.

### 2/3

**Tomoya:** Let's see... So I'm Cinderella, Hokuto-senpai's the First Prince...

Hasumi-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai are the stepsisters, Kiryu-senpai's the Second Prince...

And the Masked Pervert's both the Stepmother and Fairy Godmother. It'll be alright. I got this.

> "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo♪"

Possibility 1
> **Tomoya:** Gwah?! Wait, I don't want flowers—
>
> ...I lost a point? It wasn't Cinderella-like?
>
> Urgh... I didn't act quickly enough, so I can't blame you for deducting points.

Possibility 2
> **Tomoya:** Err, you did magic right now so...
>
> "Thank you, Fairy Godmother. With this, I can go to the ball."
>
> Heheh. Ask and you shall receive!

> "Is everything nice and clean, Cinderella?"

Possibility 1
> **Tomoya:** "I finished cleaning not so long ago."
>
> "I'll be preparing your meal next."
>
> ...Hm? Oh, I just acted out what I think Cinderella would say.

Possibility 2
> **Tomoya:** "I'm sorry, Stepmother."
>
> "I tripped on a bucket of water and flooded the hallway..."
>
> Hmm. It's better to do nothing if I'm just going to break the dishes and dirty the laundry.

### 3/3

**Tomoya:** Breathe in... Breathe out...♪

Alright, I'm all fired up now. Time to show the audience what all that practicing was for!

...Ugh, I'm still as nervous as before. Am I even gonna make it to the end?

> There's no need to fret. I'm sure you can do it.

Possibility 1
> **Tomoya:** I know. You gave me this role because you knew I could do it.
>
> Hmm, even though it feels like you just gave it to me for your own amusement...
>
> I still hope you have high expectations for me!

Possibility 2
> **Tomoya:** ...Thank you, President.
>
> It feels weird to express my thanks to you so openly but...
>
> I'm doing my best, so keep your eyes on me, okay?

> There's no need to fret. I'm sure you can do it.

> Believe in yourself.

Possibility 1
> **Tomoya:** ...I guess.
>
> I can't get into my role if I don't have any confidence in myself.
>
> I would just have to believe that I could do it.

Possibility 2
> **Tomoya:** Believe in...myself?
>
> That's surprising for you to say... Since you're nothing even like what a club president should be.
>
> But I guess what you said resonates<sup>[1]</sup> with me. Just a little bit.

## Translation Notes

1. Tomoya uses "胸に響きました" (mune ni **hibiki**mashita) here. Yes, this is an allusion to Wataru's surname.
