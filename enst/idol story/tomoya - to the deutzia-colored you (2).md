# Idol Story: Tomoya Mashiro | To the Deutzia-Colored You (2)

> **Season:** Summer<br>
> **Location:** Costume Room

**Tomoya:** (...Looks like I misunderstood something.)

(It's fun acting as other people on stage. Like, it's as if you've become a whole different person.)

(But that is only the actor "Tomoya Mashiro," not the idol "Tomoya Mashiro.")

(As an idol on stage, I have to fight as the person I truly am.)

**Wataru:** Oh? There's truly no need for you to look so despondent.

Everything you wear will suit you, and as such you'll be able to play any role you'd like. Just like your name, you are a canvas of pure white. You can be painted in any color; you can become anything your heart desires. [t/n]

Perhaps I can only view this so positively because it is precisely what I am lacking, but...

Your "problem" is actually a skill that those with strong personalities cannot obtain no matter how hard they may wish to.

**Hokuto:** That's right, Tomoya. I'm not saying you're cute without any thought, I really do think so.

You can become whoever and whatever you'd like. With that in mind, why don't you think again about what you'd like to be?

**Tomoya:** Thank you, Hibiki-senpai, Hokuto-senpai...

I'm going to rethink on how to design my personalized costume from scratch.

> **Location:** Seisou Hall Common Room

**Tomoya:** (I'm watching some idol concerts as reference.)

(...Idols really are amazing, huh. They're always shining and full of joy.)

(The venue is completely packed. I used to be the same spot, before becoming an idol.)

**Hajime:** Tomoya-kun, would you like to drink some warm milk with me?

**Tomoya:** Oh, Hajime... Yeah, sure. Thanks.

**Hajime:** Don't mention it. Is it alright if I sit next to you? I'd like to watch the concert too.

**Tomoya:** Of course. We're friends, after all. You don't have to ask for permission every time.

**Hajime:** Ehehehe, alright then. I'll plop right down♪

...Tomoya-kun, are you worried about your personalized outfit by chance?

**Tomoya:** Uh... What makes you think that?

**Hajime:** We're friends, aren't we? I felt like that might be the case.

**Tomoya:** Haha, yep. You saw right through me... It's just as you say: I'm worrying about my personalized costume—to the point where I'm starting to panic a bit.

**Tomoya:** Mitsuru was able to come up with a costume that suits him, so why can't I do the same?

I don't really know what my idol self is like at all...

I was trying to do what Mitsuru did: to use the reason why I became an idol as a reference. However, my reason for becoming an idol is so boring... "The idols I saw on TV looked amazing! Maybe I could become too," and such...

**Hajime:** Mm-mm, I don't think it's a boring reason at all... Do you remember what I told you a long, looong time ago?

I said that I wasn't really interested in idols. That I loved you and didn't want be separated from you, so I just tagged along without a single thought.

Even through the worst of times, you were always beside me, Tomoya-kun.

You befriended me, and even the reason I'm here now is because you wanted to be an idol.

Without you, the idol "Hajime Shino" wouldn't exist. I've always been considered such a dunce by others, so by now I surely would've been left behind in the dust–

I might've even stopped trying to catch up and cried in my loneliness. So please... Don't call your reason boring.

**Tomoya:** Hajime... Yeah, I understand.

(If I never thought of becoming an idol, I wouldn't be where I'm at now.)

(I would've never met Mitsuru and Nii~chan. I would've been living a dull, uneventful life.)

(Becoming an idol was a critical turning point in life for me. I didn't have to be some boring, worthless guy. I don't have to keep comparing myself to others.)

Well, why don't we brainstorm ideas for a personalized costume together? If you don't mind. You know me too well, anyways...

With you, I feel like I could come up with a design that's like those idols I've always admired—the idols that shine beyond the screen.

Tomoya-kun... Yes, of course! ♪

> **Location:** Starmaker Production Lobby

**Tomoya:** (I finished brainstorming for my personalized costume, so I brought all the sheets here but...)

Hibiki-senpai's not here, huh... Maybe I should've just called him upfront on WholeHands.

**Wataru:** Hoho. I was wondering who you were searching for—to think that it was me.

**Tomoya:** Eep! D-Don't just show up out of the blue! You should've just called out to me... Geez.

Here. This is design for my personalized costume. I took your advice and such, so I thought I'd better show the final outcome to you.

**Wataru:** So you decided on a design that draws inspiration from idols in the end.

**Tomoya:** Yeah. I'm not able bring out the idol "Tomoya Mashiro's" character yet... Which is why the classic idol outfit is the best choice!

**Wataru:** A wonderful choice. You're still pure white at the moment; I can't help but wonder what colors will burst forth from you in the future... I grow more and more eager to observe your growth. [t/n (same as above)]

**Tomoya:** Ahaha. I'm also looking forward to what my future as an idol holds.

This is only the first step... With this costume, I shall march towards that future with confidence!
