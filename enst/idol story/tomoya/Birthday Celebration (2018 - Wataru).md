**Wataru:** Happy birthday, Tomoya-kun...! ☆

I've readied an abundance of presents for you!

Oh my, you don't look too happy.

You're the birthday boy; you simply mustn't make such an expression! Very well, I shall perform some magic tricks that will put a smile on your face...☆

Roses for you! And gerberas, tulips, and some magnificent orchids! Ahaha, you're all covered in flowers! Aren't they beautiful, Tomoya-kun?

The rose petals on the cake? Hehehe, no need to fret. I assure you that they're all edible.

There's more than just flowers waiting for you, so please accept them—every last one♪
