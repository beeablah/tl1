# Idol Story: Tomoya Mashiro | Cinderella Burning at the Stake's Stage

> **Season:** Summer<br>
> **Location:** Drama Clubroom

**Hokuto:** President, do you have a moment? There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

**Wataru:** Oh? How rare of you to have business with me, Hokuto-kun!

But I could definitely spare a moment, as this Wataru Hibiki will grant all that you desire! Ahahahaha☆

**Hokuto:** Why are you hyped up all of a sudden? Calm down. Don't get so close to me, it's suffocating.

**Wataru:** Summer is upon us~! If you don't remember how to sweat correctly, your brain will start to boil due to unregulated body temperature!

**Hokuto:** You worry too much. Unlike you, I can't control my sweat. If it gets hot, I'll automatically start sweating.

**Wataru:** You mustn't give up without trying! With training, you, too, control your sweat! This is negligence, Hokuto-kun. You must aim beyond the stars!

**Hokuto:** I don't need *you* telling me that. For one, I'm not trying to be a human jack-in-a-box.

**Wataru:** Who are you calling a "human jack-in-the-box"...? What a perfectly fitting name! *Amazing☆*

Hehehe. Now then, what would you like to discuss with me?

**Hokuto:** Right... President, give him a break already.

**Wataru:** Do you know how little that narrows it down? I could think of a vast amount of people when you say that, so you have to be more specific.

**Hokuto:** It's about Tomoya. You've been sending your doves to monitor him, correct? They've been bothering him day and night.

Apparently, they also show up whenever he uses the restroom and takes baths. He can't relax because it's like you're always watching him—even in private.

It's an invasion of privacy. Tomoya's close to breaking down... For this reason, I would like you to tell your doves to stop monitoring him.

**Wataru:** Hmm? It *is* true that I had a small camera attached to my dove to keep an eye on him.

However, I was getting too bored, so I put an end to that a long time ago.

As an actor, you must always be aware that you're being watched... It's a game for him to understand the most basic of basics.

It wasn't to peek into his daily life.

**Hokuto:** Is that so? How odd, that doesn't line up with what I've been told. Tomoya says that there's *still* a dove following him.

**Wataru:** Are you sure it's not him being paranoid? Tomoya-kun must really have some mental issues...

I shall reflect on my actions. It truly troubles me that I have no idea how far is *too* far.

**Hokuto:** That's right. You *better* reconsider what you've done.

But that sure is strange... Tomoya went through a lot to show me a video of a bird you were going to train for a magic trick.

It's a special breed of dove you don't find around here.

**Wataru:** Hmm... Whatever could it be?

How mysterious! Aah, there are still so many *amazing* things hidden in this world...☆

**Tomoya:** P-P-P-Pre-Preeeez...!

**Hokuto:** ...Speak of the devil. You startled me. What's wrong, Tomoya?

**Tomoya:** Oh, good afternoon, Hokuto-senpai! You're as cool today as ever...☆

**Hokuto:** Hm? Thanks?

**Wataru:** Tomoya-kun, Tomoya-kun. Is that my dove you have there? It looks absolutely exhausted... What happened?

**Tomoya:** That's what *I'm* here to ask!

I didn't hear any wing flapping today, so I finally thought that I wasn't being chased anymore... Like I could *finally* have some peace of mind, y'know?

But something felt off, so I looked around... And there it was, passed out on the side of the road.

It would be really bad if it got ran over by a bicycle and such, so I picked it up right away.

B-But what the hell am I supposed to do now?! This is *your* bird, so do something about it...!

**Wataru:** Hehehe. It's wonderful that you can still be kind to the dove who has been chasing you around and causing you anxiety, Tomoya-kun.

Let me have a look. Ah, this is certainly one of my doves... She's been missing for quite some time now. Her name is Jeanne d'Arc.

**Hokuto:** Why does she have such a grandiose name?

**Wataru:** I named her such because she loves to perch on crosses... Oh dear, there's a fresh wound across her body. Did a stray cat attack you?

**Tomoya:** C-Can you help her? I could go grab the first-aid kit from the nurse's office!

**Wataru:** Ah, there's no need to do that. I have one right here.

My doves often get scratches whenever we do a play, so I have a first-aid kit on hand at all times♪

Please hold still, Jeanne d'Arc... This will only take a moment~♪

...Mhm, you should be alright now. It's fortunate that this isn't a grave injury, so her life isn't in any danger.

**Tomoya:** I-Is that so? What a relief...♪

**Wataru:** Yes. However, I've been worried for her health, since she hasn't been eating well. I'll make a bed for her to rest in.

**Tomoya:** Oh, I can look after her!

It's kinda weird—I guess I got attached to her since she's always with me... I was *super* worried when I saw her on the ground!

It really is weird, huh? That I feel like *this* towards a dove that's been stalking me around!

**Wataru:** Not at all. It's human nature to feel close to things that you've been around with for an extended period of time.

Since I'm always right here for you, isn't it quite like how you two are gradually coming to love me?

**Tomoya:** No. To be honest, the more I stick around you, the more it feels like I *don't* know you at all. Kinda makes me wanna move far away from you.

**Hokuto:** I know exactly how you feel, Tomoya.

**Wataru:** My underclassmen are so cruel... You made your president sad. Sob, sob.

Anyhow, I'll be taking my dear Jeanne d'Arc home to take care of her. It's likely that I have to train her all over again.

**Tomoya:** Huh, you can't leave her in the clubroom?

**Wataru:** I could, yes. Eichi would likely give me permission to keep an animal here if I were to ask him.

However, Jeanne d'Arc also has scratches from her fellow doves, not just stray cats.

She's been getting bullied by those who are supposed to be her friends.

It's a good thing you saved her quickly.

But she might not be as lucky next time, so I need to isolate her in a safe place.

**Tomoya:** Huh, bullied...? That's awful. She didn't do anything wrong.

**Wataru:** Hehehe. It's common for birds to start pecking those who are weak and don't fit in.

She's a bit like Cinderella, wouldn't you say?

And in the fairytale, Cinderella gets rescued by a prince.

But in real life, one can still face persecution even if they were saved by a prince.

People will get envious and say it's unfair—that it's favoritism...

Please keep that in mind, Tomoya-kun.

Animals love you, no? For that reason, someone who adores you could fall into misery by the weight of your fans' "jealousy."

Let this be a lesson to you, to avoid repeating the same tragedy.

Until you grow to become a prince that can rescue all the Cinderellas in the world.
