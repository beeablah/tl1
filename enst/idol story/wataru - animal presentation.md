# Idol Story: Wataru Hibiki | Animal Presentation

> **Season:** Summer<br>
> **Location:** Seisou Hall Courtyard

**Subaru:** Daikichi, Leon, lookie here~☆

Ta-da! It's a frisbee! Whoever gets it first wins the game! ☆

Allllright☆ Ready and... Fetch!

**Koga:** Don't you lose, Leon. You've gotta show everyone that you're better than these chumps!

**Tomoya:** Do your best, Daikichi. If you get first place, you'll get this gourmet beef jerky♪

**Nazuna:** Heeey, I brought some stuff we can use to set up the obstacle course!

**Tomoya:** Thanks, Nii~chan! We could use the chairs and clothes line to make a hurdle.

**Koga:** Woah, you brought some nets too. They're a must for obstacle races, but why the hell were these even in the dorms?

**Nazuna:** I brought these from Yumenosaki. I asked the tennis team's advisor if I could borrow some, but he ended up just giving me all of these old nets.

He was about to throw them all away, so he was glad I could take them off his hands.

...Oh, look at Leon. He's jumping around with a frisbee in his mouth~

**Koga:** That's my partner for ya. He didn't even break a sweat.

**Subaru:** You worked really hard, didn't you, Daikichi? There, there. You're deeefinitely gonna win next time...☆

**Tomoya:** Both Leon and Daikichi seem quite happy. Animals really do heal your soul...

**Nazuna:** You're the only one in ANIMALS that doesn't have a pet, Tomo-chin. Don't you want one?

**Tomoya:** Yeah. You're allowed to keep pets here, so I guess it'd be fine to have one...♪

But I never had a pet before. Do you guys have any recommendations for a beginner?

**Koga:** A dog, obviously. I get if ya dunno what *breed* to get, though.

**Subaru:** Yup! Dogs are great~ They're obedient; and they'll keep you in great shape too 'cause you'll need to walk 'em every day.

**Nazuna:** Rabbits are just as great! They're easy to take care of—and more importantly, they're super cute! ♪

If you're a beginner, maybe a pet you can keep indoors—like a hamster—would be good. I heard hedgehogs are easy to take care of too.

**Tomoya:** Huh, you can keep hedgehogs as pets?

I guess those are good too... But like, I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the choices.

**Koga:** Point is, you've gotta take responsibility of 'em 'til the end, got that? Pets aren't just any other animals. They're your partners, your family.

**Tomoya:** I remember now. I never wanted to have a pet because it'd be so hard to say goodbye to them.

The more we spend time together, the more painful it'd be to part with them...

**Wataru:** Ah, but aren't you aware that you'll miss out on so many important encounters if you fear parting too much?

**Tomoya:** Whoa! Was that Hibiki-senpai?

**Nazuna:** Yeah. Who else would that be, anyway?

**Subaru:** Huh? There's something moving in your shirt, Tomoya-kun.

**Tomoya:** Eh— Eeek!? When did a dove get in here?

**Wataru:** My dove isn't the only one here; I've come along as well.

Greetings from behind your back! 'Tis I, your Hibiki Wataru...☆

I'm practically green with envy, seeing all the members of ANIMALS enjoy themselves without me! How lonely it is to be left out! Sniff, sniff.

**Koga:** The hell are ya sayin'? *You're* the one who told us you couldn't come 'cause of work.

**Wataru:** Fufufu, that's correct...☆ However, I managed to finish earlier than expected, so I came to join you all.

By the way, Tomoya-kun. Do you have any recollection of that dove you're holding?

**Tomoya:** "Recollection"... Ah, is this Jeanne d'Arc?

**Wataru:** That's absolutely correct; this is the child you saved. She hasn't been bullied by those around her at all lately, and now—as you can see—she's doing perfectly well.

**Tomoya:** "Saved"? You're exaggerating. You were the one who actually took care of her.

**Wataru:** However, if you hadn't brought her to me, I wouldn't have even known of her existence. And she surely wouldn't have emerged unscathed.

So you truly did save her, Tomoya-kun.

**Tomoya:** H-Huh... Thanks.

**Wataru:** You were speaking of life spans just now, correct?

As I'm sure you're aware, although there are exceptions, animals tend to have shorter life spans than humans.

But that is precisely why we live with them and watch over them.

We need to create an abundance of memories with them so that we never forget the fact that they lived here, by our sides. That is the duty of us creatures who live longer, I believe.

In any case, I cannot recommend that you take a pet under your wing on a mere whim. Until you come to a proper decision, it would be best for you to satisfy yourself with ANIMALS' activities.

**Subaru:** Yup, yup! Lemme know anytime you wanna go on a walk with Daikichi☆

**Koga:** Leon's a lone wolf, but he'll let you pet him—don't make a habit of it, though.

**Nazuna:** And come to my room whenever you feel like spending time with rabbits. I'll make sure you enjoy their fluffiness~♪

**Tomoya:** Haha... Thank you, everyone!

**Wataru:** Speaking of walks... Dogs naturally need them, but were you aware that you can take doves on walks too?

**Subaru:** How d'you take *doves* on walks, though? Do you just put 'em on your shoulders?

**Wataru:** Not at all. I take them on walks through the sky in my hot air balloon, you see.

On that note, Tomoya-kun, let us do exactly that...☆

**Tomoya:** Woaaah! Don't jump onto the balloon while carrying meee! P-Put me down~!
