# 2★ Nene: Wonderlands×Showtime (1)

> **Location:** Phoenix Wonderland - Wonder Stage

**Emu:** Alright! Good work today, everyone!

**Tsukasa:** Yeah, see you tomorrow!

**Rui:** Good work today.

**Nene:** Good work.

......

(Everyone went home already, but I still want to practice a bit more.)

U-Umph!

**NeneRobo:** ......

**Nene:** You're the audience today, NeneRobo, so...

Please watch me sing.

**NeneRobo:** ......

**Nene:** —♪

(It's alright. I'm able to sing on stage.)

(But...)

(I wonder if I'm able to sing the same way in front of an audience.)

(What if I mess up again...?)

Whew...

Thank you all for listening.

I can finally stand on stage by myself.

But I think this was all thanks to NeneRobo being there for me.

I guess that's why I'd get scared every time I got near the stage...

Because you weren't there with me.

**Rui:** ......I see, I see.

**Nene:** ...Eep!?

**Rui:** So that's the reason why you kept bringing her around, even though she already finished her job.

**Nene:** W-Where the hell did you come from...?

**Rui:** Hehe.

I just happened to be here, so it's the perfect time to make the "surprise visit" trope a reality.

**Nene:** The hell?

**Rui:** Now, now.

Apologizes that it seemed like I was eavesdropping.

I have a present for you, see?

Your favorite grapefruit juice!

**Nene:** Are you trying to fool me now?

**Rui:** Heheheh, I suppose you could say that.

However...

Despite not using her on stage anymore, it looks like you're taking good care of NeneRobo.

**Nene:** ......

**Rui:** It's safe to say that this robot completed her role and fulfilled your dream.

But she's not leaving the stage as long as she's needed.

**Nene:** What do you mean by that?

**Rui:** I have a proposal.

Will you allow me to keep this robot for a while?

**Nene:** Huh? Are you gonna remodel it?

**Rui:** I would never do that.

Rather, I'm going to add some improvements to her.

**Nene:** "Improvements"...?

**Rui:** She's a very high performing robot.

I'll think of ways to make her more user friendly.

That way, you'll have full control of her and can stand on stage together.

**Nene:** You're alright with that?

**Rui:** Of course.

It's a director's responsibility to lend an ear to their performers.

**Nene:** ...Mhm.

But if you add anything weird, I'll get pissed. Got it?
