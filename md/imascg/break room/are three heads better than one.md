# Are Three Heads Better Than One?

**Riamu:** *Sigh,* I'm depressed. Being an idol isn't fun at all.

I knew it would suck, but...

This is depressing. This is just fucking depressing!

Aaah, I want someone to comfort me!

To keep me company, to give me attention, to tell me everything's alright...

I want it! I wanna be idolized!

...But no one's ever going to idolize me or whatever.

This break room's walls are the only friends I have!

Aaah, I'm sooo lonelyyyy!

**Akari:** Akira-chan, here!

This is the break room everyone's talking about!

**Akira:** I see.

\#BreakRoom #AKA #GameRoom #FunTimesWithEveryone

**Akari:** But I don't think this is a game room...

Ah! It's Riamu-san!

Riamu-saaan, good work out there!

**Akira:** Good work.

**Riamu:** Eh!?!?

...Huh? Is this a dream?

Is someone calling me?

Is this a dream...?

**Akari:** ......?

**Akira:** ......

**Riamu:** Why aren't you guys saying anything?!

You're being awfully silent! It's suffocating!

Can't you be a little bit nicer to me?

**Akari:** Hmm... Ah!

Riamu-san, thank you for performing with us in our last gig♪

There were so many other idols!

The city's amazing as well!

It was quite enjoya-ple!

What about you, Akira-chan?

**Akira:** Well, that was the first time I had this feeling...

Also, there were a lot of idols wearin' good clothes...

Lots of nice clothes.

**Riamu:** Ehh, it wasn't good enough for me.

I wanna stand out and get a shit ton of attention...!

**Akari:** Wow... Amazing, Riamu-san...

You're really unique, and you have a nice dream too.

I guess that's what being an idol is all about.

**Akira:** I wouldn't say that her dream's that great...

She definitely has personality, though.

**Akari:** Ugh, I wonder if I can match up to you...

I'm not the type that stands out too much, y'know?

**Riamu:** Alright then! Let's stir up some drama while we're at it!

As long as we're together, we'll be fine!

**Akari & Akira:** ...Huh?

**Akari:** No, no! You can't just start drama...!

All the things you care about will go to waste!

**Riamu:** But there are so many other idols out there!

If you don't stand out as much as possible, you won't survive!

Hey, Riamu-chan wants to survive!

**Akira:** Don't.

Stirrin' up drama will just cause trouble for the agency.

Aren't there other ways you can think of to survive?

**Riamu:** I wanna stand out! With drama!

Isn't starting drama mental?

I wanna stand out as a joke!

**Akira:** Eh...

Riamu-san, why are you so problematic...?

**Riamu:** It's because I wanna stand out!

Because I want people to care about me!

Because I wanna get some attention, at least!

**Akira:** If it's like that, then there should be another way.

With drama, you'd constantly have to worry about dealin' with radical opinions.

**Riamu:** ...So, I should just join the military.

**Akari:** The military!? What the he—

Ah, I mean, why?

**Riamu:** Because people in the military are really smart, obviously!

Let's come up with some genius ideas that'll turn me into a cool officer character!

I'm 19, y'know!?

I want my juniors to rely on me!

I wanna make you two happy!

**Akari:** W-What should we do, Akira-chan?

Riamu-san saying all of that isn't any good!

**Akira:** Hey, both of you calm down.

First off, it makes no sense to havin' a panic attack here.

Don't people relax here?

**Akari:** T-That's right! Ahahahaha!

I just started panicking all of a sudden!

Uh... Hm... Eh...

Ah!

Why don't we get some ramen?

**Akira & Riamu:** Ramen?

**Akari:** Let's go eat!

Eating tasty food with friends always cheers me up!

Cheer up, Riamu-san.

Your problematic thoughts might go away!

Besides, Tokyo's ramen always looked so trendy and delicious. I've always wanted to try it...!

**Akira:** Ah... In that case, I know a good place.

It's from my hometown that just opened a Tokyo branch...

But I guess that isn't really Tokyo ramen, huh.

**Akari:** Aha♪ As long as it's good, it's OK!

**Riamu:** Eh, huh!? What the hell!?

I'm gonna eat ramen with someone...!?

Is this a dream? A dream to end all dreams!?

**Akira:** This is reality.

**Akari:** Riamu-san, let's go as a grou-ple♪

**Riamu:** You're joking... You're seriously not joking...?

Idols are so nice...

I wuv nice idols...!
