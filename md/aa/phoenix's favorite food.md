# Phoenix's Favorite Food

**Trucy:** The question is, "What is your favorite food or drink and why?"

**Phoenix:** My favorite food, huh...

**Trucy:** It's apples, right, Daddy?

**Phoenix:** Well, I don't hate them.

**Trucy:** It must feel nice crunching through all that "red stuff."<sup>[1]</sup>

Though, you said it would be even better if it had white frills<sup>[2]</sup> on it.

**Phoenix:** Wait, I don't remember saying that.

**Trucy:** Huh?

Didn't you eat apples a lot after trials back then?

You bit into them with a glare as if it's your enemy.

...Or at least, that's what I heard from Miss Fey.

**Phoenix:** M-Maya...

Trucy, you really shouldn't trust her.
