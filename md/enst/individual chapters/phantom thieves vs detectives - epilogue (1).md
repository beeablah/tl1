# Phantom Thieves VS Detectives: Epilogue (1)

> **Season:** Winter<br>
> **Location:** Museum-like Stage

**Tomoya:** One, two, three, four! Hop, hop, hop♪

...Alright, that's perfect. Tomoya Mashiro has made a full recovery♪

(Ra*bits were lucky enough to be the main act for today's live...)

(I gave it my all in order to keep up with everyone else, but I couldn't show off my strengths.)

(Hajime and Mitsuru are improving at such an incredible rate. They always had more potential than me since the very beginning.)

(I was on break for only a few days, but it's like I've already been left behind.)

(I also need to work harder.)

(The Mystery Stage just reached its turning point. Sena-senpai also said that the "riddles" after today will be even more troublesome.)

(I don't know if we can successfully crack them like today.)

(I need to be prepared for them by the next time we're the main act so that I can show-off myself. Nothing will be lost that way.)

(I have to fight tooth and nail. But I can't become an idol all by myself.)

(In order to take everyone's hands and move forward, I must go the extra mile.)

(I would be a burden to others if I don't. No... It's because I continue standing on the same stage with everyone.)

(I can do it~ I'll stay after practice for a bit♪)

**Wataru:** Are there any naughty children here~? What a pity, there's only an average child☆

**Tomoya:** That scared me?! Woah, the Masked Pervert appeared!

**Wataru:** Ahaha. Tomoya-kun's reactions are amusing as usual. It has a rather shocked value to it, hehehe!

How are you? You won't faint, correct?

**Tomoya:** I'm not that scared... What, wouldn't you typically shout "Are you surprised? You're surprised, aren't you! How *amazing!* ☆" with such glee?

**Wataru:** Tomoya-kun really can't imitate me well...

I am much more refined than *that!* My grace shines through even when I'm spouting nonsense, right?

**Tomoya:** Go look at a mirror.

Uwah, on closer inspection, you're wearing some weird costume.

You're not even participating in the Mystery Stage, so why are you dressed up as a phantom thief?

**Wataru:** No, I was thinking of adding something *amazing* into the mix if the whole unfolding felt boring.

So I made a variety of arrangements, and I'm wearing one right now as a test.

Though, looking at everything that has happened, it looks like my turn will never come.

**Tomoya:** Yeah, I never thought *you'd* show up... Err, do you need something from me?

**Wataru:** No? I already said that I would stay behind the scenes. I'm here to clean up after the Mystery Stage is over because this auditorium will be used for class tomorrow.

Cleaning it up everyday...

And set everything back up before the show begins. It relies on physical strength more, so I couldn't ask Miss Anzu to come and help.

**Tomoya:** So it's like that, how tiring... Would it be better if I came and helped out?

**Wataru:** No, no. I already feel like lecturing you for staying back to practice. It wouldn't be my problem if you push yourself too hard that you faint again.

Please leave this kind of work to the backstage staff. You should go home immediately and get a good night's sleep to eliminate your fatigue.

Living life in the fast lane won't do any good. I know you can't curb your enthusiasm, but being idle is part of our jobs as idols.

**Tomoya:** ...You saying such wise words<sup>[1]</sup> feels out of place.

**Wataru:** How painful. I always gave you advice in hopes of happy growth and even taught you with such care!

Aaah! This unrequited love is a tragedy that would render even Shakespeare speechless with shock!

**Tomoya:** Uhm... You're always helping me improve, even if you *are* an absolute nutjob.

But to be honest, I can't really keep up with your footsteps...

**Wataru:** Indeed. What is truly a pity is that you're not Wataru Hibiki. I have forgotten about that and regret it greatly.

However, I shall forget about that in the blink of an eye tomorrow☆

**Tomoya:** Please keep it in mind a bit longer. Seriously, you're always saying such careless things...

I still want to practice some more. I don't want to get in your way, so is it fine if I dance here?

**Wataru:** Sure. Don't mind me, do as you wish. However, if you mess anything up, I'll use a roundhouse kick to stop you.

**Tomoya:** Can you be a little more gentle? That roundhouse kick will kill someone. I'm still recovering, so please be careful with me~

**Wataru:** What a spoiled child you are.

Well, don't fret about it. I might have ran into you by chance...

But I won't get any closer, since I wouldn't want to hurt you again.
I shall leave right after I've finished cleaning up, so please pretend I'm not here.

I am quite inconsiderate and can only protect you by staying away.

**Tomoya:** Is that so? Then why did you watch today's show despite saying you'd "stay away" from me?

You were sitting in Row D, Seat 23, right?

**Wataru:** Oops, I've been found out. My disguise should have been perfect.

**Tomoya:** Too perfect that it's unnatural.

The one most unlike you in today's audience was the guy sitting in Row D, Seat 23.

He was at our S3 too...

Speaking of which, that guy was always around. You've been watching over me the whole time, huh? I didn't expect you to worry *that* much.

**Wataru:** Oh, oh... How embarrassing. This is Wataru Hibiki's greatest mistake.

Thinking that someone as clueless Tomoya-kun would *never* see through my disguise, I slacked off, only to fail in the end.

**Tomoya:** Are you trying to piss me off?

## Translator's Notes

1. Localized from "先輩らしいこと" (*senpai*-like things). Wataru doesn't act like a "proper" *senpai* most of the time, which is why Tomoya felt off. [The relationship between *senpai* and *kouhai* is quite important.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senpai_and_k%C5%8Dhai) Adding to that, *kouhai* usually talk to their senpai using [honorific speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese), but Tomoya often drops his formalities when talking to Wataru.
